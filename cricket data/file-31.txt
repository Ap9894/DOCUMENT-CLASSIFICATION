Victoria vs South Australia

On a flat Junction Oval wicket, a draw always loomed large. And on Day 5, the captains shook hands half an hour before Tea to call the game off early. South Australia finally declared on 671 for 6. Tom Cooper finished on 271 not out whereas Tom Andrews hit his maiden first-class hundred. The two batsmen put on a 210-run partnership as bowlers, mostly spinners, bowled the majority of overs on the final day.

Brief Scores:Victoria616/6 (Nic Maddinson 224, Will Pucovski 123, Marcus Harris 116)drew with South Australia 671/6 (Tom Cooper 271*, Alex Carey 117, Thomas Andrews 101).

Queensland vs New South Wales

New South Wales registered a win over Queensland on the final day. Harry Conway picked 5 for 39 to finish the match with a 10-fer and restrict Queensland to 268 in the second essay, meaning NSW had to chase 134 for a victory. Daniel Hughes scored 66 not out to guide the chase but it looked tricky when they were reduced to 53 for 5. David Warner fell for a first-ball duck to Michael Neser, who also picked Steven Smith 21. Later, Hughes put on 81 runs for the sixth wicket with Nevill to lead their side to a win.
