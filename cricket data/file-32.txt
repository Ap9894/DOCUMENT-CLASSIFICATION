N Gopalswami, BCCI's electoral officer, has issued a clarification that the complaints related to the compliance by the member associations and the conduct and results of state association elections lie on the Committee of Administrators, and in doing so, distanced himself from the objections raised over several candidates after the full electoral roll for the BCCI AGM was issued on October 10.

After the draft roll was announced on October 4, objections were allowed to be raised till October 7. The nominees against whom objections were raised were given till October 10 to issue a clarification, on the basis of which the final draft roll was released.

One of the key objections raised was over Delhi and District Cricket Association's nominee Rajat Sharma finding his name in the final electoral roll. The objection was with regards to DDCA being in violation of the Lodha recommendations with OPA Sharma, an MLA, serving as the treasurer of the association. The complaints of biased approach further heightened with Manipur Cricket Association's Rajkumar Imo Singh being disqualified from the final electoral roll on grounds of discharging public duty as a Congress MLA.

The bigger issue, however, came with the nominees of BCA, OCA and Uttarakhand finding their names in the final electoral roll even without the respective associations having their constitutions registered, while the likes of Maharashtra Cricket Association, Tamil Nadu Cricket Association and Haryana Cricket Association were disqualified for not being compliant.

Another major concern raised was over the disqualification of the three government associations - Services, Railways and Indian Universities - for not having selected their representative from the players' association, which none of them have due to practical difficulties.

In a statement released on Saturday (October 12), Gopalswami said, "The scope of the Electoral Officer's remit during scrutiny of applications for nomination of Representatives of compliant Full Members was to determine (i) whether the nominee had been properly authorised in accordance with the constitution of the Member Association, as approved by the CoA, and the BCCI constitution and (ii) whether the nominee was eligible to act as a Representative in terms of the constitution of the Member Association, as approved by the CoA, and the BCCI constitution."

The electoral officer, in stating his responsibilities, has put the onus of answering these questions on the Committee of Administrators.

"Where the Electoral Officer deemed necessary, the Representative was provided an opportunity to respond in writing or during a personal hearing, to relevant objections to his candidature," he added. "The scrutiny was completed after due consideration of the objections received, responses provided and information relating to the compliance status of Full Members, as provided by the CoA to the Electoral Officer."
