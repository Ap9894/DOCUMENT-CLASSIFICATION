Stats highlights from India's innings win in the second Test of the series against South Africa in Pune

11 Series wins in succession at home for India - the most by a team. The sequence started in 2012/13 when they blanked Australia 4-0. India went past Australia's record of ten consecutive series wins which they achieved twice - between 1994/95 and 2000/01 and again from 2004 to 2008/09.

2010 - The last time South Africa lost a Test by an innings margin - by an innings & 57 runs against India in Kolkata. This happens to be only India's second innings victory against the Proteas. It is also the second instance of South Africa losing by an innings and 100-plus runs against an opponent other than Australia and England after losing by innings and 153 runs against Sri Lanka at the SSC in 2006.

2008 - The last instance of a team enforcing follow-on against South Africa - England at Lord's in 2008. This was the first instance of India enforcing follow-on against South Africa. It was the seventh instance of India enforcing follow-on under Virat Kohli, five of it resulting in wins with two ending as stalemates.

30 Wins for Virat Kohli in his first 50 Tests as captain - third-most behind Steve Waugh (37) and Ricky Ponting (35). This was India's eighth innings win with Kohli in charge - joint second most for India along with Mohammad Azharuddin, and only behind MS Dhoni's nine such wins.

41.95 - Average balls per partnership by teams for wickets six to ten against India since January 2018. This is the third most among the top nine Test sides in the world behind Sri Lanka (46.36) and England (44.20). However, the average balls per stand for the first five wickets against India read as 51.82, which in turn is the lowest against an opponent in this period.

Top five vs bottom - opposition-wise (since Jan 2018)

Opposition Tests Balls/Dis (1-5) Balls/Dis (6-10) Diff Ratio

India 19 51.82 41.95 9.87 1.24

England 22 60.22 44.20 16.02 1.36

Sri Lanka 18 63.00 46.36 16.64 1.36

West Indies 14 61.31 35.29 26.02 1.74

South Africa 16 60.71 32.27 28.44 1.88

Australia 18 72.09 41.82 30.27 1.72

Bangladesh 11 75.49 39.73 35.76 1.90

New Zealand 11 76.66 33.93 42.73 2.26

4 Instances of South Africa's last five wickets doubling the score after the fall of the fifth wicket in the innings. In three of the four innings in this series so far, the visitors lost their first five wickets inside 80 runs.

22.25 Average runs per wicket for South Africa's openers in the sub-continent since 2014 - the lowest among all the visiting teams apart from Ireland, who played a solitary Test in Asia. Dean Elgar opened in each of the 21 innings and scored 606 runs at 30.30 with two hundreds. In the 21 innings at the other end, others have managed just 296 runs at 14.80 with a highest score of 39.

5 - Aiden Markram became the third South Africa opener to bag a pair since re-admission. The others to do so are Gary Kirsten and Herschelle Gibbs, who bagged it twice in his career. In four Tests away from home for Markram, all in the sub-continent, he has scored just 84 runs at 10.50 with three blobs.

6 - This was South Africa's sixth consecutive Test loss away, starting from the last two matches in England in 2017 - the longest such run for them since re-admission in 1992. Incidentally, they have lost the toss in each of these six Tests.
