Anshuman Gaekwad (471 votes) beat Kirti Azad (381) and Rakesh Dhurve (223) to clinch the post of the Male ICA Representative to BCCI Apex Council, in the first ever Indian Cricketers Association elections. Shanta Rangaswamy had gone uncontested for the female post of the same.

For the posts of ICA secretary and treasurer respectively, Hitesh Majumdar (646 votes) beat Ashu Dani (436) and V Krishnaswamy (739) beat Kishor Kumar Sharma (336). The other positions - Ashok Malhotra for president, Rajesh Nayyar and Yajurvindra Singh for ICA Member Representative, and Surinder Khanna for ICA Representative to IPL Governing Council - went uncontested.

In the state chapters of the ICA elections, Amar Petiwale and Jayashree Kulkarni became the male and female representative respectively in Baroda Cricket Association. Among the other elections for male candidates in states had Suresh Mahadevan (27) beating Hemant Angle (9) in Goa Cricket Association, Parth Sathwalekar (48) beating Mirza Faiyaz Baig (21) in Hyderabad Cricket Association and Brijinder Sharma (19) beating Vijay Singh Sen (6) in Himchal Pradesh Cricket Association. In Kerala Cricket Association, Sambasiva Sarma (32) won against Renjith Menon (21) and S Manoj (0).

Among the elections for female representatives in Uttar Pradesh, Eitti Chaturvedi (30) beat Reena Singh (25).

All the other posts either had no representation or went uncontested. The low turnout among domestic cricketers was a cause of concern to begin with. And to add to that, with even the registered members, several were unaware of the process of voting, which went on from October 11 to 13. In the online voting process, while some cricketers claimed that they didn't receive any emails, some others had issues with their logins. More than 200 registered members didn't vote.
