Northern vs Southern Punjab

A superb effort from the bowlers provided the foundation for Northern's win over Southern Punjab on Monday (October 14), as they restricted them to a score of just 135 - a target that was chased down in 19 overs.

Having opted to bat first, Southern Punjab captain Shan Masood and Sami Aslam were snapped up by Mohammad Amir in his first spell, following which there was a tedious recovery effort. But a couple of run-outs combined with Sohail Tanvir's three-fer put paid to all hopes of a decent target.

In reply, Nothern got off to a sticky start against a fired-up Mohammad Irfan who made a couple of quick inroads. But Umar Amin's half-century steadied the ship, before Asif Ali shut the door on the opposition with a quickfire 44 off just 24 balls, even as Zahid Mahmood threatened a late comeback with a lovely spell of 2/14.

Brief Scores: Southern Punjab 135-9 in 20 overs (Aamer Yamin 33, Sohaib Maqsood 25; Sohail Tanvir 3-27, Mohammad Amir 2-19) lost to Northern 137-5 in 19 overs (Asif Ali 44, Umar Amin 50, Mohammad Nawaz 24; Mohammad Irfan 2-19, Zahid Mahmood 2-14) by five wickets.

Balochistan vs Sindh

A massive score of 233 proved more than enough for Balochistan as they opened their account in the tournament with a 52-run win over Sindh. Their opening pair of Imam-ul-Haq and Awais Zia had blazed off in the powerplay, which fetched over 60 runs. Even Imam's dismissal for 25 did nothing to stop Zia, and more importantly, the run-rate, as he found a willing partner in Bismillah Khan.

The duo smashed half-centuries each, taking the Sindh bowlers to the sword in a 99-run stand for the second wicket. Unfortunately, the misery wasn't to end there. Amad Butt swooped in with a late cameo of his own, spiking the total to 233. Amidst all this, Mohammad Hasnain may have picked up three wickets but he also went for 42 in his four overs.

Sindh got off to a blazing start of their own, but the dash upfront from Abid Ali and Khurram Manzoor was shortlived and couldn't seep into the rest of the lineup. Twin three-fers from Akif Javed and Amad Butt further dented the chase. So by the time Sarfaraz Ahmed got going, it was destined to be a lost cause.

Brief scores: Balochistan 233-6 in 20 overs (Awais Zia 77, Bismillah Khan 54, Amad Butt 31; Mohammad Hasnain 3-42) beat Sindh 181 all-out in 19.4 overs (Abid Ali 41, Sarfaraz Ahmed 36, Khurram Manzoor 33, Saud Shakeel 28, Ahsan Ali 23; Amad Butt 3-32, Akif Javed 3-42) by 52 runs.
