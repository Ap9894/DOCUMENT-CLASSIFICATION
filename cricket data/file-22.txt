New South Wales were forced to move their Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania due to the pitch concerns at the Sydney Cricket Ground, it was confirmed on Monday (October 14). The track is now in a race against time to be ready for the Australia Domestic One-Day Cup Clash against the visitors.

The reason for the damage, according to NSW, was Sydney Roosters practice session in the lead up to the NRL grand final. "It is a great disappointment to our players and everyone at Cricket NSW that we can no longer play there over the next week," Lee Germon, Cricket NSW chief executive, said.

"Our male players were looking forward to playing four of their five home Shield matches and a one-day match at the SCG this season, something that has rarely happened over the past decade or so. Our off-season training and planning was based squarely around the fact that most of our matches would be at the SCG this season, creating an extra buzz of excitement.

"It is important that our current and future international cricketers have the opportunity to play as much cricket as possible on the SCG."

The SCG Trust, however, stressed the damage wasn't because of the training session, according to the report in cricket.com.au. They further added the track wasn't ready in time for the Shield clash.

SCG is scheduled to host a T20I between Australia and Pakistan on November 3.
