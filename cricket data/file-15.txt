WORLD CUP FINAL AFTERMATH





Boundary count scrapped as tie-breaker in ICC events

Boundary count will no longer be used to decide the result of a semi-final or final at an ICC event, in case of a tied Super Over.

"Instead, the Super Over will be repeated - for as many times as it takes - until one team has scored more runs than the other."

"In Semi-finals and Finals, there is one change to the Super Over regulation in keeping with the basic principle of scoring more runs than the opponent to win, the Super Over will be repeated until one team has more runs than the other," the ICC stated in a release on Monday (October 14).

The World Cup final earlier this year had stirred great controversy when New Zealand were adjudged to be second-best on account of a lower boundary count - a parameter which seemed to have little cricketing base. And now, on review by the ICC Cricket Committee, it has been scrapped altogether.

Apart from that, there's another change, whereby the Super Over will now be employed even in Group Stages of ICC tournaments to pick a winner. But, unlike the knockouts, it won't be repeated after a tie. Rather, points will be split between the teams.

"Following on from a recommendation from the ICC Cricket Committee, the Chief Executives' Committee agreed that the use of the Super Over as a way to decide results at ICC events will be retained. Both the Cricket Committee and CEC agreed it was an exciting and engaging conclusion to the game and will remain in place covering all games at both ODI and T20I World Cups," the release further added.
