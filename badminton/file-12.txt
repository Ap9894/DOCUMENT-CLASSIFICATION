| Logos become an indispensable part of the identity of the brand or    |
| group they represent. The inverted Y inside a circle for Mercedes,    |
| the black horse for Ferrari, the Nike swoosh, the Adidas three        |
| stripes are some unforgettable logos of our times.                    |
| There are three basic parts of a logo - THE LOGOTYPE (LETTER MARK),   |
| THE ICON (SYMBOL), AND THE SLOGAN. It's essential that your logo      |
| should be distinct and easily distinguishable to avoid confusion.     |
| Most of the companies, corporations, brands use logos these days.     |
| Thus it has become to recognize a logo without its name. But there    |
| are a few logos, like the Red Cross, the red ribbon of the Coca Cola  |
| logo which work against language barriers and countries because of    |
| their immense popularity and wide spread usage.                       |
| Logo designing is a significant area in the field of graphic design   |
| in today's world. The logo is seen as the embodiment of a group. Some |
| of things that should be kept in mind when designing a logo are - be  |
| practical, avoid using too many colors, work with design              |
| infringements, avoid using complex images or photographs of a live    |
| person, refrain from using images which might offend sensibilities,   |
| while creating the logo use vector graphics which would help adjust   |
| the size of the image without losing its basic functionality.         |
| Badminton logos can be of two types - first the ones that REPRESENT   |
| THE SPORT ITSELF. 'A white stick figure holding a racquet and aiming  |
| at a shuttlecock' is the Olympic logo for badminton, for example. The |
| second ones are the badminton logos which REPRESENT VARIOUS TEAMS,    |
| TOURNAMENTS ETC.                                                      |
| Teams adopt logos which become representatives of the team, the head  |
| of a bull for Chicago Bulls for example. Team logos bind team members |
| and induce team spirit. The team logo is either embroidered or        |
| printed on the uniforms of each player.                               |
| In a single player game, players often sport their country's flag     |
| instead of any other logos. Many a times, in case of professional     |
| badminton circuit, there are sports goods companies which sponsor     |
| players. These sponsorship contracts require the players to sport the |
| logo of the company on their uniforms.                                |
| Some years back, the Indonesian Badminton Association, for example,   |
| got into a hitch with the sport's goods manufacturer Yonex, and was   |
| facing a compensation claim of $255,000, as the players did not wear  |
| the standard issued uniforms of the Yonex Company at a practice match |
| in West Java.                                                         |
| The contract however required them to wear Yonex shirts and use their |
| racquets in all matches in Indonesia and overseas. Yonex paid about a |
| million dollars in sponsorship to the Indonesian Badminton            |
| Association.                                                          |
| With graphic designing becoming a thriving profession there is a wide |
| range of designing firms available to cater to your individual needs. |
| All you need to do is to clue them about the nature of your group/    |
| team and the various contexts in which the logo might be used.        |
| Badminton logos for example would adorn the player's uniforms, would  |
| be used for publicity, and for identification during tournaments. A   |
| logo should ideally be transferable from one context to another       |
| without losing its significance and viability.                        |
