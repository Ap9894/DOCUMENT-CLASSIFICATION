| There is no substitute for long hours of practice and single minded   |
| dedication. PROPER GUIDANCE AND RIGOROUS COURT WORK can help you      |
| improve your techniques and make your game better.                    |
| The first thing that you need to take care of is your GRIP - the way  |
| you hold the racquet. It is the base groundwork of playing badminton  |
| sports. Holding the racquet wrongly can reduce the power behind your  |
| strokes, which can be a major disadvantage. It will also limit the    |
| range of shots you can play and hence you might not enjoy the game    |
| itself. There are two basic types of grips in badminton sports - THE  |
| FOREHAND GRIP AND THE BACKHAND GRIP.                                  |
| GOOD FOOTWORK is a skill that you need to excel in to be a winner in  |
| badminton sports. Good footwork will help you get to stray shots      |
| while maintaining your balance and dodge your opponent. Jump, skip,   |
| bounce, shuffle, glide, lunge are some of the things you need to do   |
| on a badminton court. Adjust your base position according to the      |
| strengths and weaknesses of you and your opponent.                    |
| A well timed and well placed serve is the most effective arrow in     |
| your quiver when playing badminton. MASTERING VARIOUS TYPES OF SERVES |
| - high serve, flick serve, low serve and drive serve is important to  |
| improve your game.                                                    |
| After the serves comes the clears - MOST CRUCIAL OF ALL THE BADMINTON |
| STROKES that can be played overhead or underarm. They can be played   |
| on both forehand and backhand sides. Practicing your clears can       |
| improve your game to a great extent.                                  |
| Badminton drop shots are DELICATE SHOTS which when played with the    |
| right placement and timing can ensure you an upper hand in the game.  |
| They can be played on backhand as well as forehand sides too. The     |
| idea is to force the opponent to move to the front court so that the  |
| mid court and the back court remain free. Drop shots in badminton     |
| sports are of two types - slow drop shot and fast drop shot.          |
| A well executed smash shot is the DEADLIEST WEAPON that you can use   |
| on a badminton court. The power, speed, angle and trajectory of a     |
| smash shot will determine how difficult it is for your opponent to    |
| recover. A smash shot hit towards the downward direction with optimum |
| force is ideal.                                                       |
| Drives are shots which cross over the net FLATLY IN A HORIZONTAL      |
| TRAJECTORY. Drives are attacking shots that are used when the         |
| shuttlecock is too low for you to hit a smash. These shots can be     |
| played straight down the court or diagonally. They are used more in   |
| doubles games, where it is advisable to keep the shuttlecock at a low |
| height.                                                               |
| Badminton net play is an important area of the game which requires    |
| great amount of refinement. These are delicate shots which involve a  |
| SUDDEN CHANGE OF THE ANGLE OF THE RACQUET to confuse your opponent.   |
| Net shots are of three types - net shot, net kill and net lift.       |
| You can learn the techniques of badminton sports by working under a   |
| qualified coach or observing the skills of professional players. But  |
| there is no substitute for hard labor if you want to be good at it.   |
