| Until recently, unfortunately not enough such resources were          |
| available for a common man. In the past there were many players who   |
| complaint about lack of necessary help and quality assistance from    |
| their coaches.                                                        |
| And, sometimes simply due to their poor economic conditions many      |
| players weren't able to join this great sport. Apart from moral and   |
| monetary support, they need expert tips and guidance in order to gain |
| proficiency in this game. We'll share some of the badminton tips      |
| here:                                                                 |
| One of the most important techniques in the net play area is the      |
| Lunge. Here are some of the main technical aspects:                   |
| AIM:The objective should be crystal clear. The aim is to get the      |
| shuttle back in to the court and trap the opponent down at the net.   |
| This will force the opponent to lift the shuttle up and short,        |
| thereby offering you an opportunity to attack.                        |
| TECHNIQUE: The most preferred method is to approach the net and Lunge |
| aggressively. The racket leg must work like a brake to your movement. |
| This act will produce the required force thereby generating the       |
| stroke with a minimum amount of racket head movement. The focus must  |
| be given on reaching out and taking the shuttle within the minimum    |
| possible time.                                                        |
| This will facilitate you to get the shuttle over the net and get back |
| in to the play close to the net on the other side. When playing the   |
| shot, it is important to face the racket parallel to the floor. Grip  |
| the racket handle lightly in the fingers. You must experiment with    |
| your grip to get this movement.                                       |
| However, it is also necessary to impart some spin on the shuttle and  |
| making it 'tumble'. YOU MAY MOVE THE RACKET HEAD SLIGHTLY IN AN OUTER |
| MOTION TO INCREASE THE TUMBLE ACTION. LIFTING THE RACKET HEAD         |
| slightly will maximize the effect.                                    |
| PRACTICE: The best way to practice is to work with a friend. To       |
| practice the technique, the feeder should stand on the service line   |
| and feed shuttles to the net both underarm and overarm. This mimics   |
| the shuttle play to the net in a game.                                |
| Top tips for beginners:                                               |
| - WARM-UP: Preparing the body well prior to the game is important.    |
| Hence, you need to indulge in a gentle jog or skipping to warm-up     |
| your body. Once your body is warm, stretch the major muscle groups    |
| concentrating on legs, back and shoulders.                            |
| - PRACTICE THE GRIP: Focus on the grip when choosing a racket. If you |
| have small hands, small grips are ideal and vice-versa. Concentrate   |
| on a relaxed grip when holding the racket. You can excel in forehand  |
| and backhand shots with the help of a flexible wrist.                 |
| - SHUTTLE: The shuttle you choose should not wobble.                  |
| - BASE POSITION: Returning to a central base position is a good       |
| decision.                                                             |
| - PLAY INDOORS: Find a proper court to practice.                      |
| - BE PREPARED: Badminton is an unpredictable game and you require     |
| moving in any direction within a certain period of time. So know your |
| body limits.                                                          |
| - STRATEGY: Make a game plan. It would be advisable to discover your  |
| opponents' weakness.                                                  |
| - CROSS-TRAIN: Involve in physical activities that would increase     |
| your flexibility such as Brisk Walking and Jogging.                   |
| - COOL-DOWN: Once you are over with your practice, end with a         |
| cool-down session. This may include a gentle walk and light           |
| stretching.                                                           |
