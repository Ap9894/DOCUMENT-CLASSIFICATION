| The court is rectangular in shape and divided into two halves by the  |
| net. The two halves are further divided into forecourt and backcourt  |
| areas. The courts are always marked for both singles and double's     |
| games and the net poles are planted outside the double's lines.       |
| The rally is initiated by the serve. A serve is always hit in the     |
| upward direction and its attacking potential is limited by various    |
| restrictions and service laws. A serve can be of different types -    |
| high serve, low serve, drive serve(hit flat towards the back area of  |
| the opponent's court) and flick serve(hit upwards, but low            |
| trajectory).                                                          |
| There are many different types of basic badminton shots, which are    |
| played from different areas of the badminton court. FROM THE          |
| FORECOURT AREA, THE VARIOUS SHOTS THAT CAN BE PLAYED ARE -            |
| 1. Net Shot: dropping the shuttlecock into the opponent's forecourt,  |
| as close to the net as possible.                                      |
| 2. Net Lift: playing upwards towards the back of the opponent's       |
| court.                                                                |
| 3. Net Kill: the shuttlecock is aimed steeply towards the floor of    |
| the opponent's court, close to the net.                               |
| BADMINTON SHOTS FROM THE MID COURT AREA INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING -       |
| 1. Smash: when the shuttlecock comes to you at a high level in the    |
| midcourt area, hitting it aggressively towards the opponent's floor,  |
| to finish the rally.                                                  |
| 2. Drive: when the shuttlecock is at the net height, at the side of   |
| your body, hitting it with sufficient pace to the opponent's midcourt |
| or backcourt area.                                                    |
| 3. Push: hitting the shuttlecock softly into the opponent's forecourt |
| or front midcourt area. This shot too is played in the same situation |
| as a drive.                                                           |
| 4. Lift: playing upwards towards the back of the opponent's court, in |
| response to a smash or a push shot.                                   |
| MOST BADMINTON SHOTS IN THE BACK COURT AREA ARE PLAYED OVERHEAD. SOME |
| SHOTS IN THIS AREA ARE -                                              |
| 1. Clear: hitting the shuttlecock high to the opponent's backcourt.   |
| Clear shots are of two types - defensive clear and attacking clear.   |
| 2. Smash: hitting the shuttlecock steeply towards the opponent's      |
| midcourt, at high speed.                                              |
| 3. Dropshot: hitting the shuttlecock downwards towards the opponent's |
| forecourt.                                                            |
| Besides these there are various advanced strokes which are more or    |
| less, slight variations on the aforementioned basic strokes. The      |
| purpose of an advanced stroke is to introduce an element of SPIN INTO |
| THE SHOT catching your opponent unawares.                             |
| Slicing, hitting the shuttlecock with an angled racquet is a          |
| technique commonly used for advanced strokes. Slice shots veil the    |
| direction in which the shuttle is going to hit and to make the        |
| disguise powerful shots by making them travel slowly.                 |
| Double motion is another useful technique to deceive your opponent.   |
| It involves making an initial movement towards the shuttlecock and    |
| then changing the face of the racquet and hitting it in a different   |
| direction.                                                            |
| Some professional players use triple motion too, but it's much more   |
| complicated and hence rarely used. To win a game u need to employ a   |
| combination of various badminton shots strategically.                 |
