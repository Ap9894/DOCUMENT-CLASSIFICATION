| To be good at this sport requires a combination of multiple assets    |
| like physical strength, flexibility, co-ordination, quick thinking.   |
| Here is all you need to know about badminton training to improve your |
| game and increase your stamina.                                       |
| A badminton training program is much more than just game practice. It |
| includes nutrition advice, rest, psychology, stretching exercises and |
| weight training. An ideal training program gives you desired results  |
| and is time- efficient too. Basic and long term training programs     |
| help build stamina and fitness over long durations through regular    |
| exercising and practice.                                              |
| Specialized badminton training programs however help players gain a   |
| winning edge over their opponents. A training session is an           |
| appropriate combination of work out sessions and conditioning work.   |
| 'Ghosting', which means players rally with an imaginary shuttle cock, |
| taking different stances and positions, is the commonly used method   |
| for the latter. However, the mode and pace of ghosting changes        |
| throughout the session. A badminton training session can be modified  |
| according to specific needs, TARGETING A PLAYER'S WEAK AND            |
| PROBLEMATIC AREA.                                                     |
| Other than this badminton training involves various exercise          |
| routines. Start with short spanned rigorous exercises like running,   |
| jumping or ghosting. Intense rallying would help to build up stamina  |
| and endurance.                                                        |
| To choose an individual badminton training program it's essential to  |
| assess your strengths and weaknesses- both mental and physical.       |
| Physical weaknesses are relatively easy to deal with.                 |
| Thirty minutes of cardio vascular exercises 30 minutes a day, three   |
| times a week would significantly improve your stamina. Cardio work    |
| outs should be ideally avoided right before a game though.            |
| Weight training and leg exercises like sprinting help increase        |
| explosive power on the court. Short sprints one day a week is ideal   |
| for badminton players. There are various kinds of sprints and         |
| exercises you can take up:                                            |
| 1. PARTNER BALL THROW - stand with your eyes closed and let the       |
| partner throw a soft, spongy ball towards you from the other side of  |
| the net. Open your eyes after you get a signal that the ball has been |
| thrown. Now try to catch the ball as soon as possible.                |
| 2. BALL RETRIEVAL - place a number of shuttlecocks along the net      |
| line. Run to the shuttles and retrieve them one by one to a chosen    |
| base, say the back edge of the court. Timing yourself is also an      |
| option.                                                               |
| 3. PLYOMETRIC EXERCISES - hopping and jumping, at a fast pace with    |
| small contact time between the feet and the ground. These exercises   |
| can be strenuous however and should be done in the presence of a      |
| coach/trainer and in optimum fitness levels only.                     |
| Strength training, twice a week will help you gain extra power to     |
| fuel your game. Various abdominal exercises using weights or Swiss    |
| balls can be adapted to different fitness levels. It will add that    |
| extra power to improve your serve and returns by toning your mid      |
| section area.                                                         |
| You can adjust your badminton training to your specific fitness level |
| and needs. Advice of a qualified coach is always recommended.         |
| Observing the game of a professional can help you improve your        |
| tactical ability and skills.                                          |
| A positive frame of mind is an indispensable asset of a winner. Avoid |
| pessimistic thoughts and tendencies to give up. PERSEVERANCE AND      |
| PLANNING ARE KEYS TO SUCCESS, in anything and everything that you     |
| decide to do.                                                         |
