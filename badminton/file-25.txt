steady and calm.

| But as the time draws nearer to enter the court, nervousness begin to |
| sip in and all of a sudden the player feels unconfident.              |
| The time that was used for the strenuous hours of training suddenly   |
| seemed insufficient to take on their opponents. NERVOUSNESS begins to |
| take over all emotions and players begin to tell themselves that they |
| are going to lose a match which they have yet to begin.               |
| Everything seems to be all going wrong at this point of time. But     |
| this is a normal behavior. It is perfectly normal to feel this way    |
| when a player is about to begin his first match in a competition,     |
| especially if it's the first competition that he or she is            |
| participating.                                                        |
| BEING NERVOUS IN A GAME CAN COST A PLAYER TO LOSE IT. When a player   |
| feels nervous, he or she cannot be able to perform at his peak.       |
| Strokes cannot be delivered and unforced errors begin to happen. The  |
| heart beats faster than usual and players begin to feel tired very    |
| quickly compared to his normal training sessions.                     |
| All this are because of jittery nerves. Ever feel yourself in this    |
| position before? Well...there are a few things that you can do to     |
| reduce such nervousness in a badminton game.                          |
| 1. DO NOT GIVE UP and don't tell yourself that you are going to lose  |
| when the game has not even started.                                   |
| 2. Be confident in yourself. Do not let the opponent's reputation     |
| instill fear in you. If he/she is more popular in the badminton       |
| circle, this should inspire you more to win him as you have no        |
| pressure at all because you are the underdog.                         |
| 3. Prepare yourself mentally and think of what your strengths are the |
| night before the competition. This is to boost your own confidence    |
| and let you focus on the strengths that you have to beat and overcome |
| your opponent.                                                        |
| 4. Always concentrate on the game and not what others say. Do not let |
| others influence you by saying that it is impossible to win someone   |
| who is greater than you. NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS WORLD.         |
| 5. BE DETERMINED of what you want to achieve the moment you step into |
| the court. Be sure of the goals that you want and work towards it!    |
| 6. Do something that you can relax to before the game starts. Such as |
| listening to some music that can calm and soothe your nerves or       |
| laughing and joking around with your friends.                         |
| Sometimes being nervous inside a badminton court is not exactly bad.  |
| Not all bad things are bad as you can change negative influences to   |
| positive ones. It is the way you look at things.                      |
| Being nervous sometimes gives a person that extra adrenaline rush     |
| which can lead to their victory, but if a player is unable to manage  |
| those nerves and give in to it, half the battle will already be lost  |
| before it has even started.                                           |
| Being nervous before a game is something everyone has to go through   |
| in life when they play their first competition. Cold sweat and cold   |
| palms are alright.                                                    |
| It is impossible to eliminate nervousness each time we step into the  |
| court for a match. To improve is not how you eliminate nervousness,   |
| but it is how well you MANAGE IT and how you USE IT TO HELP YOURSELF. |
