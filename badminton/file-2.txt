| Any institutionalized competitive endeavor that fulfils one's         |
| personal aspirations (sense of achievement and satisfaction) and      |
| objective yearnings (popularity and prosperity) would satisfy the     |
| criteria for a sport. And, going by this definition, badminton would  |
| fit the bill in anybody's mind.                                       |
| BADMINTON COMPARES FAVORABLY WITH ANY SPORT, CERTAINLY WITH ANY       |
| RACKET SPORT, JUDGING BY THE SHEER PHYSICAL EXERTION AND MENTAL       |
| CONCENTRATION INVOLVED. Badminton is one of the fastest racket sports |
| and the fastest racket shot has been recorded in badminton.           |
| The average badminton match may not last as long as a tennis match,   |
| but the average time that the shuttle is in play is significantly     |
| much longer than the tennis ball. Also, the average badminton rally   |
| lasts much longer than in tennis, and the number of shots taken in a  |
| second, especially in a game of doubles, is many more than in tennis. |
| The on-court movements in a game of badminton are also more, with a   |
| player completing nearly a mile on the court. Also you are on your    |
| toes all the time, constantly changing positions and lunging and      |
| exploding in different directions to retrieve and return the ball.    |
| The game also involves intense mental concentration, akin to chess,   |
| continually anticipating and pre-empting your opponent's moves. From  |
| the health freak's perspective too, badminton is a sport, providing a |
| complete overall workout for the body and mind.                       |
| Badminton is certainly the most participation intensive racket game.  |
| Over the past decade, badminton has outstripped tennis in terms of    |
| increase in popularity, at least in the rest of the world. But this   |
| fact is belied by the comparatively miniscule television coverage     |
| that the game receives.                                               |
| The media and the sponsors, apparently, still do not perceive the     |
| game as popular. One would expect this attitude to affect the         |
| popularity of the game, but in contrast the number of people who are  |
| taking to the sport is steadily increasing. To the truly discerning   |
| sports fan, the game advertises itself.                               |
| The world has realized this, where badminton has grown in popularity  |
| by leaps and bounds. This is one game, which is dominated by the non- |
| white people. We don't know if this is one reason why the game is     |
| being cold-shouldered in certain countries, where the average fan is  |
| still besotted with other sports. WITHOUT DETRACTING FROM THE GLORY   |
| OF THESE OTHER GAMES, BADMINTON IS, BY NO MEANS INFERIOR TO THEM.     |
