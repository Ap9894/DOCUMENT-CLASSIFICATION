| However, as a ground reality we know finding a good badminton joke    |
| can be a real challenging task especially when finding offline or in  |
| printed formats, as you may have to search for several books,         |
| magazines or other literature.                                        |
| Whereas, the online world is really different, as you can easily find |
| numerous badminton jokes online these days. Contrary to the recent    |
| past, these days there are many online websites that are especially   |
| dedicated to jokes. Depending upon your choice you can search for     |
| different jokes in different categories, such as cricket jokes,       |
| tennis jokes and even badminton jokes.                                |
| No doubt, badminton is a serious racket game that requires a lot of   |
| stamina and practice to win the game, but there is something unique   |
| in it to make it a funny sport. Though, as far as quality is          |
| concerned, you may not be able to find a really funny joke, cartoon   |
| or picture so easily. But still there are a lot of badminton funny    |
| cartoons and pictures available on the Internet.                      |
| Those who have a little knowledge know that cartoons about the sport  |
| of badminton have a long history associated with them. One of the     |
| most famous and recorded badminton funny cartoons was published by    |
| PUNCH MAGAZINE IN THE YEAR 1854.                                      |
| Let's come back to badminton jokes. One of the most simple and short  |
| badminton jokes could be "BAD MINTON". Badminton is unquestionably a  |
| very popular sport around the world. Perhaps there is something       |
| really funny in the name itself, e.g. there are many terms and        |
| accessories associated with the sport that make this sport a funny    |
| one, such as "shuttlecock", "shuttle",""cock", "love all", "service   |
| over" and "change ends" etc.                                          |
| Jokes are jokes; they can come in any form or type, so it all depends |
| upon who says and what, and in what circumstances. For example, it is |
| said that in order to score in badminton a player must place his cock |
| in his opponent's court with thrust. It is really funny when it is    |
| generally said that in badminton a player may only handle the cock    |
| before serving or after scoring.                                      |
| I still remember, when a childhood friend of mine once said, "If a    |
| player does not get the cock into his opponents court for any reason  |
| then he does not score and cannot try again until he has service      |
| again."                                                               |
| I am sure, everybody who in some form or other is related to          |
| badminton sport, knows that in badminton damaged cocks aren't used as |
| this can cause irritation to the court surface. No doubt, courts are  |
| delicate so should be handled with utmost care and delicacy.          |
| Therefore it is sometimes said that rubber covers (of course in       |
| badminton) are highly advised for safety as they are about 99% less   |
| likely to damage the court.                                           |
| Wise people say beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. So true,     |
| especially when it comes to jokes. There are many people who may not  |
| laugh even at decent jokes, whereas there are people who would start  |
| bursting at some simple lines. If you don't believe then see these    |
| lines:                                                                |
| "Courts with worn or damaged patches should not be used for at least  |
| two weeks."                                                           |
| "We don't need new balls in badminton."                               |
