| For the FAST AND AGGRESSIVE STYLE, most of the shots played are       |
| smashes, fast drop shots and net shots, attacking lobs, more low      |
| services than high services, quick low pushes/flicks to the backcourt |
| from the net and fast pace footwork on the court.                     |
| For the DECEPTIVE STROKE PLAYERS, there are more high services to the |
| baseline than low services, the lobs are more angled and deep, the    |
| drop shots are deceptively played and they drop nearer the net. The   |
| net shots are sharper and more deceptive but are not played as fast   |
| as the attacking pattern of play. Most of the strokes they play are   |
| deceptive strokes to trick and slow down their opponent.              |
| Moreover, the defenses of players who play this style are usually     |
| better and more reliable. Their push shots to the back are more       |
| angled and deceptive. This pattern of play requires less smashes and  |
| the movements of deceptive players are smoother and steadier, with    |
| better court craft.                                                   |
| For the STRAIGHTFORWARD AND DEFENSIVE STYLE, most of the shots are    |
| plain and simple as opposed to being deceptive. Most of the services  |
| are high and deep on to the backcourt, the net shots are not tricky   |
| but simple and very few cross-court net shots. The drop shots are     |
| sharp but not as fast as the attacking pattern of play.               |
| In this playing style, the main purpose is to wear the opponent down  |
| by playing consistently simple effective shots, making very few       |
| mistakes. The players that are categorized in this type of play       |
| normally have higher and stronger stamina because they are used to    |
| the long rallies.                                                     |
| Nearly all top players play a combination of two styles with one      |
| style dominating, such as Zhao Jian hua, combining effectively the    |
| attacking style with deceptive stroke play. Foo Kok Keong, Ong Ewe    |
| Hock and Ardy Wiranata played a straight forward, defensive style.    |
| They sometimes resort to fast attacking style.                        |
| Rudy Hartono was a fast attacking player. P. Gopichand is mainly a    |
| deceptive stroke player who sometimes uses the attacking style of     |
| play. Susi Susanti was a standard defensive and straightforward style |
| badminton singles player.                                             |
| Nowadays, many players like to play the fast attacking style which    |
| was introduced by Rudy Hartono with lots of jumping smashes and       |
| attacking lobs. Most of the aspiring young players of today also      |
| usually follow or try to imitate their idols or go with the trend     |
| because they believe that they can apply it to their badminton        |
| singles game to win matches.                                          |
| You shall always remember that your idols are individuals too and if  |
| you want to be a champion like them, you must believe and have        |
| confidence in your individuality.                                     |
| TO FIND OUT WHICH STYLE SUITS YOUR BADMINTON SINGLES GAME, YOU CAN    |
| ASK YOURSELF A FEW QUESTIONS SUCH AS:                                 |
| * Do I have a good temper and emotional intelligence to play this     |
| type of game?                                                         |
| * Am I the impatient aggressive type who takes risks? A temperament   |
| more suited to the attacking style.                                   |
| * Or am I the hardworking type who enjoys winning opponents using     |
| long rallies? Temperament more suited to the defensive style.         |
| * Or am I the patient player who loves playing a quality game and     |
| gets a lot of satisfaction in controlling the opponent? A temperament |
| more suited to the deceptive stroke player.                           |
| THERE ARE ALSO A SECOND SET OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU CAN ASK YOURSELF    |
| SUCH AS:                                                              |
| * Do I have the physical ability to play this type of badminton       |
| singles style?                                                        |
| * Does the strength to execute continuous sharp and very powerful     |
| smashes come easily to me?                                            |
| * Am I physically too short to play the aggressive type of game, like |
| giving me little time to cover the court well as compared to a tall   |
| player whose reflexes are just as fast as mine and their court        |
| coverage are better?                                                  |
| * I have lots of physical fitness and good mental toughness. How      |
| should I use them effectively?                                        |
| THE THIRD SET OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU CAN ASK YOURSELF:                 |
| * Do I have the ability to produce the shots to play this type of     |
| game?                                                                 |
| * Are my shots mostly straightforward, consistent and deep or are     |
| they deceptive?                                                       |
| * What are my most potent strokes? The smash, the defense, the lob,   |
| etc?                                                                  |
| It is important for you to discover yourself and your style of        |
| badminton singles play. Do not just follow or copy the trend or your  |
| idol's pattern of play. Only then can you develop your own style to   |
| the highest possible standard and challenge others.                   |
