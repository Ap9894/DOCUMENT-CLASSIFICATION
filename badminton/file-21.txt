| Without the physical fitness, a player will have difficulties to keep |
| up with the long rallies and the fast pace of the game.               |
| So it is crucial to improve one's physical attributes when playing    |
| badminton by doing outdoor trainings especially jogging and sprinting |
| besides other exercises like shot's perfection, weight training,      |
| drills, jumping and stretching.                                       |
| If you are still not convinced about the importance of jogging and    |
| sprinting to improve your speed and endurance, consider the fact that |
| a badminton match lasts from 20 minutes to 80 minutes without the     |
| sufficient time to rest during each rallies. If a player doesn't have |
| the stamina and the endurance that is really required in Badminton,   |
| he can lose lots of points due to fatigue.                            |
| Jogging can also be considered as PART OF THE WARMING UP SESSIONS for |
| a player's badminton training regime and before a badminton match. It |
| is normally done after the stretching. It helps to condition you to   |
| suit the badminton hall's environment because different hall has      |
| different types of environment.                                       |
| It also helps to SETTLE DOWN MENTALLY AND REDUCE THE NERVOUSNESS OF   |
| THE PLAYER before the match begins. Top players normally jog around 5 |
| minutes before his match starts in every tournament.                  |
| Other than used for the warming up sessions, jogging is also often    |
| used as part of the training sessions. The trainees normally do       |
| intensive jogging to raise their endurance level so that when they    |
| are in the game, they can sustain the tough and physically demanding  |
| side of things.                                                       |
| By consistently doing intensive jogging, it helps to strengthen your  |
| legs so that you can do more drills that capitalize more on speed     |
| such as fast shadow, shuttle control, multi shuttle drills and etc.   |
| Without the presence of the strong legs, you won't be able to play a  |
| high quality badminton game.                                          |
| Jogging helps to strengthen the legs by consistently moving in a fast |
| pace. UPHILL JOGGING IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE EXERCISES TO        |
| STRENGTHEN THE LEG'S STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE LEVEL.                    |
| Your agility can also be improved. JOGGING HELPS TO STABILIZE THE     |
| FOOTWORK so that players won't stumble all over the court to retrieve |
| their opponent's shots. How often have you been in this situation     |
| whereby the shuttle has fallen a fraction out of your reach even      |
| though you know it's going to land there? If you had been able to     |
| turn or move to the shuttle a bit faster, you could have reached it.  |
| Jogging can be used as an addition to a player agility exercises such |
| as skipping, hopping and etc. I would highly recommend you to jog in  |
| small and fast steps. TRY TO STAY ON YOUR TOES OR ON THE BALLS OF     |
| YOUR FEET WHILE JOGGING.                                              |
| Sprinting in badminton is chiefly done to increase the speed of your  |
| court coverage. Many players have difficulty to keep up with the      |
| speed of the game due to the lack of speed itself. BY HAVING SPEED,   |
| IT CAN CREATE AN ADVANTAGE BY ENHANCING A PLAYER'S ANTICIPATION.      |
| Anticipation is referring to a condition where the shots are          |
| unexpectedly taken much earlier. It has a high percentage of          |
| finishing the rally. Speed increases the footwork abilities to be     |
| able to anticipate shots.                                             |
| In the modern Badminton games, speed plays a major role to win a      |
| game. Why is it so? Because most badminton players in the world goes  |
| for speed and power to win the game. Speed and Power was introduced   |
| by Rudy Hartono of Indonesia which had won the All England title for  |
| the record of 8 times. Without the presence of speed, you will have   |
| difficulty to raise your game to another level.                       |
| The right way to do the sprinting is to sprint on your toes. It is    |
| good for the leg to have lesser contact to the ground so that players |
| can create stronger legs. Usually SPRINTING IS DONE AT THE END OF THE |
| TRAINING PROGRAM so that the trainees can build up their mental       |
| strength when they sprint with exhaustion creating the best effect.   |
| The very common method used by top player is sprinting up the hill.   |
| Sprinting uphill will strengthen the legs and raise their endurance   |
| level because it demands a lot of physical and mental fitness. For    |
| the record there are some good example of Top players that often      |
| sprints up the hill such as Lin Dan (World Champion 2006), Mohd Hafiz |
| Hashim (2003 all England champion), Lee chong wei (2006 commonwealth  |
| games champion) and other players as well.                            |
| All these jogging and sprinting methods will definitely improve your  |
| game and fitness. Most importantly, it will also bring your game up   |
| to the next level.                                                    |
