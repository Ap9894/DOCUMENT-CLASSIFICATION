The Importance of Mental Toughness

Many Badminton players are good in the physical aspect but not tough
enough MENTALLY. A badminton player can have all the fitness, power,
agility and skills but without the presence of mental toughness, he or
she can be affected mentally anytime, anywhere.

| Marathon runners are good examples. Normally most of the marathon     |
| runners reach their stamina limits in the last 12 KM over 42 KM. But  |
| their strong mental ability allows them to keep running at the same   |
| pace to finish the race. Some runners even increase their speed to    |
| finish the race although they are already exhausted.                  |
| Marathon runners call this method 'HITTING THE WALL', meaning pushing |
| to the limit. Even the legendary Tan Yee Khan of Malaysia uses the    |
| method of 'hitting the wall'. This method should be applied by        |
| badminton players who aspire to go one step further in the game.      |
| Whether it is during the game or training, players should keep        |
| focusing and pushing their body to the limit.                         |
| A match could take a rather long time to end. A good badminton player |
| or in other words an 'established badminton player' will not go down  |
| without a fight and should be able to keep their pace and the         |
| accuracy of their shots until the very last point in the game no      |
| matter how long they have played. This is where MENTAL TOUGHNESS      |
| plays a big role.                                                     |
| You can be a very skillful player and fit player but if you meet an   |
| opponent who has a much higher level of stamina and fighting spirits, |
| you will very likely lose the match if without the ability to push    |
| yourself when you are exhausted. There are plenty of instances        |
| whereby players are not strong enough mentally and emotionally, lost  |
| focus because of tiredness and gave up easily in the game.            |
| Sometimes you can be leading far ahead in the game like reaching game |
| points or match points and you are already thinking about victory.    |
| This should not be a habit of a badminton player because you might    |
| lose the game if you meet a player with great fighting spirits. You   |
| maybe be leading 14-0 or 19-10 but no matter how far you lead, you    |
| still have to stay focus until the game is over.                      |
| A good case in point would be the game that featured Hafiz Hashim and |
| Lee Hyun ll in the quarter finals of the 2006 DOHA Asian Games. Hafiz |
| was leading 19-10 at one stage in the first set, but could not stay   |
| focus and lost the set 22-20 in the end. He could not recover from    |
| this set back in the second set and lost the tie. Lee Hyun ll showed  |
| his MENTAL TOUGHNESS AND FIGHTING SPIRITS in this instance.           |
| A good player should always possess the 'NEVER SAY DIE' attitude even |
| if their opponents are leading by a huge margin just as Lee Hyun ll   |
| has shown in the Asian Games. Another good case in point would be the |
| game in between Lee Chong Wei and Lin Dan during the Malaysia Open    |
| 2006.                                                                 |
| Lin Dan was already leading 20-13 in the rubber game and this was a   |
| really difficult situation for Lee Chong Wei because one mistake is   |
| enough to cost him the match. But he handled the pressure well and    |
| showed a greater desire to win, slowly clawing back in to the game.   |
| Finally, he won that game 22-20 and surprised the whole world.        |
| Mental toughness can also give you an edge like FOCUSING ON THE MATCH |
| no matter what is happening around, keeping you calm and cool in the  |
| court. Having mental toughness is having a high EQ (emotional         |
| intelligence). Many incidents, good or bad, can happen during a match |
| outside or inside the court. For example, players can be              |
| psychologically affected by bad line calls, umpires decisions or      |
| insulted by the audience.                                             |
| There were cases of top players which were emotionally affected such  |
| as the case in one of the game which featured Taufik Hidayat in an    |
| Indonesian local tournament. He was insulted by an audience that      |
| directed harsh words at him. Taufik then runs up to the audience      |
| chair and confronted him.                                             |
| During Thomas cup 2002 Finals in Guangzhou and 2002 Busan Asian Games |
| he fell prey again to his emotionally vulnerability caused by the     |
| umpire's decisions and bad line calls which led him to lose the game. |
| In the 2006 HK open, he walked out of a semifinal game against Lin    |
| Dan because of a bad line call. No doubt he is a very good player,    |
| but if he could just control his emotions a bit better, he can be one |
| of the all-time greats.                                               |
| In many cases, players without much exposure are easily intimidated   |
| by the situation on hand and were not able to play their usual game.  |
| Mental toughness is needed to overcome all the fear with a 'nothing   |
| to lose', 'give everything you got' mentality. When fear is overcome, |
| the confidence will be there to win the game. You need to keep        |
| THINKING POSITIVELY in the game, no matter what happens.              |
| Badminton players should be equally strong, physically and mentally.  |
| Mental toughness will determine your success as a BADMINTON PLAYER    |
| and will help you attain consistent achievements.                     |
