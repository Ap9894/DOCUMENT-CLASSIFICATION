| There are many different types of ways to train up your badminton     |
| skills. Today, I am going to focus more on training up your power.    |
| There are many ways to increase the strength of a badminton player's  |
| shot. One of the most common ways used is BY TRAINING WITH A SQUASH   |
| RACKET                                                                |
| Why use a squash racket? Well the answer to that question is          |
| simple... The grip size of the squash racket is similar to that of a  |
| badminton racket, unlike the tennis racket where its grip size is a   |
| little different to that of the badminton racket.                     |
| Using a squash racket for training will make a player's SMASH         |
| STRONGER. To illustrate this, Martial Art students will tie something |
| heavy on their legs, like stone, metal or sandbags while they train   |
| as this will help them to produce and execute a more powerful kick.   |
| The squash racket training works in the same way as this.             |
| Using a squash racket also trains a player's wrist to be more         |
| flexible. As the grip size of the squash racket is similar to the     |
| grip size of the badminton racket, players can do many exercises      |
| involving wrist work such as wrist rotation, backhand, forehand,      |
| drive and etc...                                                      |
| If a player uses a tennis racket to do this, it will make their wrist |
| stiff because of its thick grip. The squash racket training is also   |
| part of a badminton player's warm up. Normally, most players will     |
| take a few swings on the squash racket as a warm up before stepping   |
| onto the court.                                                       |
| By doing this, you will feel that the badminton racket is much        |
| lighter and easier to swing during trainings and even competitions.   |
| It will give you a slight advantage. When a squash racket is used for |
| training, it will not stiffen a player's wrist.                       |
| By doing other weight trainings, players wrist might become stiffer   |
| if it was done too many times or too often. However, players can do   |
| the squash racket training everyday WITHOUT THE FEAR THAT THEIR WRIST |
| WILL BECOME STIFF as it is like training with a heavy badminton       |
| racket. It also prevents players from injuring their wrist as by      |
| doing this training, a player's wrist not only gets stronger, but     |
| also more flexible.                                                   |
| But if you are just starting out on the game, it is not advisable to  |
| train with the squash racket right away because it can cause injury.  |
| This is because you might not be used to the heavy weight of the      |
| squash racket. Well, I am sure that this will help you in your game,  |
| and all the best in your badminton career.                            |
