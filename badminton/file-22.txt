| Badminton players need to be more fit than tennis players in that the |
| time the ball remain in play, average length of rallies and distance  |
| traveled by players during the game are all significantly higher in   |
| badminton. In other words, THE ENDURANCE LEVEL OF BADMINTON PLAYERS   |
| SHOULD BE VERY HIGH.                                                  |
| Also it is worthwhile remembering that badminton is significantly     |
| faster than tennis, so the player needs to be in peak fitness to run, |
| stretch, dive, bend, jump and reach the birdie with lightning quick   |
| reflexes and body balance. Speed is the key to winning.               |
| FOR BADMINTON FITNESS TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE METHODS ADOPTED TO IMPROVE |
| FITNESS SHOULD BE SPECIFIC TO BADMINTON. For example, there is no     |
| need to strengthen jaw muscles for badminton, as it serves no useful  |
| purpose in developing the playing skills of any badminton player.     |
| Specific badminton fitness involves strengthening of the wrist,       |
| elbows, shoulders, neck, chest, abdomen, back, thighs, knees and      |
| ankles. Because these are the body areas that are actively involved   |
| in playing badminton. Consequently, strengthening these areas by      |
| specific exercises improves the fitness and strength of the player,   |
| enabling him to endure better during play.                            |
| THE SECOND IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ACHIEVING BADMINTON FITNESS IS THAT IT |
| SHOULD BE PROGRESSIVE IN NATURE. That is, the fitness of the player   |
| should be gradually improved by gradual upgrading of the exercise     |
| employed.                                                             |
| For example, let us consider that a badminton player's on court       |
| endurance is going to be improved by exercise. For the first few      |
| days, the player should be instructed to jog in casual speed for up   |
| to 10 minutes. Once he is able to do that without any difficulty, he  |
| must be allowed to do it in peak jogging speed.                       |
| After attaining the second level also, the duration should be         |
| gradually increased, say 15, 20, 25 minutes. By doing so, his fitness |
| is gradually upgraded without subjecting him to risk of training      |
| injuries and undue fatigue.                                           |
| Even with the above methods of specific and progressive badminton     |
| fitness training, any player is going to feel stale on repeatedly     |
| doing the above. He consequently looses interest, which may affect    |
| his performance at the subconscious level.                            |
| TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM, VARIATION IN BADMINTON FITNESS TRAINING IS  |
| TO BE PRACTICED. Variations should attempt to make the player staying |
| focused and interested in training sessions and at the same time help |
| to improve his fitness day after day.                                 |
| For instance, the player can be instructed to do jogging, skipping,   |
| hopping or swimming in different days to keep his interest in         |
| training alive. If he starts enjoying his training sessions,          |
| naturally it will translate into better on court performance.         |
