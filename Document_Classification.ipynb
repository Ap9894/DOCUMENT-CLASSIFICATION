       "[['\\n\\nWhat is Badminton?\\n\\nWhat is badminton other than a fun and exciting racket sport? Well\\nbadminton can be a lot of different things for you.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| Playing badminton whether for fun as a hobby or on a more competitive |\\n| level will improve your overall health significantly when done for at |\\n| least 30 minutes a day. Many national and official health             |\\n| institutions recommend that you attempt to raise your heart rate for  |\\n| A MINIMUM OF 30 MINUTES A DAY to keep your metabolism at a healthy    |\\n| rate as well as to lower your resting heart BPM (beats per minute).   |\\n| Other than simply being healthy for the benefit of raising your heart |\\n| rate and all the positive effects of raising your heart rate,         |\\n| badminton is often a total body work out. When you practice or even   |\\n| play a full match of badminton (three games) you will have been       |\\n| moving for at least 30 minutes and you will be using muscles that you |\\n| are not always aware of. By moving your body quickly around the court |\\n| and swinging your racket for the shots you are exercising almost      |\\n| every muscle in your body without even thinking about it.             |\\n| When you exercise to build muscle and tone your body the main goal is |\\n| to exercise the muscle to the point of exhaustion. This is done by    |\\n| repeatedly stretching and working any muscle you want to tone. By     |\\n| stretching and working the muscle you activate the muscle fibers      |\\n| which release hormones into your body that help your body to increase |\\n| the tone and mass of your muscles. Badminton can help you to do this  |\\n| and that can be part of what is badminton.                            |\\n| Moving from front to back and side to side of the badminton court     |\\n| will not only exercise all the muscles in your legs it will help you  |\\n| to build muscle. The repetition in the actions you are taking as you  |\\n| play the game tends to work much like the repetitions you will find   |\\n| in many weight lifting programs, minus the weights.                   |\\n| Instead of using weights to build the muscle you are repeatedly       |\\n| carrying the weight of your body and the momentum that adds to that   |\\n| weight. Often if you were to work out in a fitness gym or club you    |\\n| would be sitting to lift the weights, in badminton you are not only   |\\n| activating the fibers in your muscles that help to strengthen them    |\\n| you are combining that with aerobic activity creating a total work    |\\n| out for your legs.                                                    |\\n| When you combine this leg work out with swinging your racket in all   |\\n| sorts of directions to return all types of badminton shots you are    |\\n| incorporating all of your upper body muscles into this workout as     |\\n| well. The swinging of the racket will be close to weight lifting as   |\\n| well.                                                                 |\\n| Even though most badminton rackets are light weight and easy to swing |\\n| you are adding that little bit of weight along with the momentum of   |\\n| the swing, this activates far more muscle fibers than if you were to  |\\n| sit and simply do repetitive lifting of a heavier weight. And again   |\\n| you are combining this type of weight lifting with aerobic all body   |\\n| activity to produce a raised heart rate and increase your metabolism. |\\n| As you think about this you may wonder why there are not huge overly  |\\n| muscular badminton players. This is not because they are not reaping  |\\n| the full benefit of the badminton work out it is simply because       |\\n| badminton is going to be a toning sport.                              |\\n| The activity that is involved will help you to tone your muscles all  |\\n| while burning excess calories and fat deposits. Beside if you were to |\\n| create a huge muscular physical state for yourself you would no       |\\n| longer have the quick agile ability to move around the court as a     |\\n| successful badminton player needs.                                    |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n ',\n",

       " ['Badminton for Beginners\\n\\n\\nBadminton for Beginners\\n\\nBadminton for beginners can be explained in many different forms.\\nHowever for the person who is very unfamiliar with the game of badminton\\nit can be compared to several different sports that may help to explain\\nthe idea and benefits of the game of badminton.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| Badminton is much like tennis in that it can be played with teams of  |\\n| two (two people on each opposing team) or as a singles game where one |\\n| person plays against another single person. Both of these sports      |\\n| including other sports such as Squash, Racket Ball and Ping Pong use  |\\n| a type of racket (in Ping Pong a paddle). However the differences     |\\n| between badminton and these various racket sports are many.           |\\n| Different from tennis, badminton uses a shuttlecock, otherwise known  |\\n| as A SHUTTLE OR BIRDIE and the shuttle is not allowed to hit the      |\\n| ground as in tennis. Squash is another racket sport that is played    |\\n| with two players but differs in several ways from badminton.          |\\n| In the game of squash two opposing players take turns hitting a       |\\n| rubbery ball against a wall. The rackets are shorter at the handle    |\\n| and have a larger target area or \"sweet spot\". Each player hits the   |\\n| ball against the wall, usually quite violently and their opponent is  |\\n| supposed to return the ball to the wall by hitting it themselves.     |\\n| In the game of squash there are similarities as well, when the        |\\n| opponent misses the ball and does not hit it back to the wall the     |\\n| other player scores a point. In squash the ball is allowed to hit the |\\n| floor once much like tennis. If the ball bounces on the ground more   |\\n| than once a point is given to the opposing team.                      |\\n| Much like badminton there are deceptive shots in both tennis and      |\\n| squash and both sports use the same types of strikes. The strikes     |\\n| will include different variations of backhand, forehand and around    |\\n| the head shots.                                                       |\\n| Ping pong is much like a miniature tennis game that is played on a    |\\n| table. It can be considered to be like badminton and other racket     |\\n| sports as the goal is to score points by ensuring that your           |\\n| competitor does not get the proper chance to hit the hollow plastic   |\\n| ball back to your end of the court.                                   |\\n| The ping pong table looks much like a small version of a badminton or |\\n| tennis court and is raised to waist level with a small 6 inch net     |\\n| stretching across the middle. The players must hit the ball across    |\\n| the net, it is allowed to bounce once and then needs to be returned   |\\n| to the opposer by way of hitting it with a paddle.                    |\\n| All of these sports have the same general idea which is to score a    |\\n| point on your opponent by creating sufficient doubt or hesitation     |\\n| causing them to miss the shot available. There are deceptive shots    |\\n| and similarities in the types of swing in all these games when        |\\n| compared to badminton.                                                |\\n| The main differences will be the subtle differences in the equipment  |\\n| and scoring systems. They are all great games but badminton is one of |\\n| the most exciting in my book.                                         |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n ',\n",

       " [\"\\n\\nBadminton Shots: Upgrade Your Game\\n\\nThe sport of badminton originated in Greece, about 2000 years ago. From\\nthere it has now traveled to various countries all over the world. The\\nfirst step to learn how u play is to familiarize yourself with the\\nrules, regulations, badminton shots, court structure, equipment and\\ntechniques of the game.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| The court is rectangular in shape and divided into two halves by the  |\\n| net. The two halves are further divided into forecourt and backcourt  |\\n| areas. The courts are always marked for both singles and double's     |\\n| games and the net poles are planted outside the double's lines.       |\\n| The rally is initiated by the serve. A serve is always hit in the     |\\n| upward direction and its attacking potential is limited by various    |\\n| restrictions and service laws. A serve can be of different types -    |\\n| high serve, low serve, drive serve(hit flat towards the back area of  |\\n| the opponent's court) and flick serve(hit upwards, but low            |\\n| trajectory).                                                          |\\n| There are many different types of basic badminton shots, which are    |\\n| played from different areas of the badminton court. FROM THE          |\\n| FORECOURT AREA, THE VARIOUS SHOTS THAT CAN BE PLAYED ARE -            |\\n| 1.

       " [\"\\n\\nBadminton Shots: Upgrade Your Game\\n\\nThe sport of badminton originated in Greece, about 2000 years ago. From\\nthere it has now traveled to various countries all over the world. The\\nfirst step to learn how u play is to familiarize yourself with the\\nrules, regulations, badminton shots, court structure, equipment and\\ntechniques of the game.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| The court is rectangular in shape and divided into two halves by the  |\\n| net. The two halves are further divided into forecourt and backcourt  |\\n| areas. The courts are always marked for both singles and double's     |\\n| games and the net poles are planted outside the double's lines.       |\\n| The rally is initiated by the serve. A serve is always hit in the     |\\n| upward direction and its attacking potential is limited by various    |\\n| restrictions and service laws. A serve can be of different types -    |\\n| high serve, low serve, drive serve(hit flat towards the back area of  |\\n| the opponent's court) and flick serve(hit upwards, but low            |\\n| trajectory).                                                          |\\n| There are many different types of basic badminton shots, which are    |\\n| played from different areas of the badminton court.

       " ['\\n\\nBadminton Instruction\\n\\nBadminton is a great game to get involved in and badminton instruction\\ncan be simple when laid out in a clear and concise manner.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\nThe interest in starting to become involved in the game of badminton can\\noften be abandoned due to the lack of easy direction provided for many\\nbeginners. Here you will find a simple and easy step by step instruction\\nfor playing badminton.\\nEvery game of badminton involves SERVING, OFFENSE AND DEFENSE. The game\\nis played to score points on your opponent or opponents, depending on\\nwhether you are playing a game of singles or doubles. A singles\\nbadminton game is you against another player and a doubles game consists\\nof you and a partner playing against two other competitors.\\nThe first step in badminton instruction will be to decide who will get\\nthe starting serve. This is usually done with the flip of a coin or some\\nother random selection process. After the serve is decided the team that\\nhas won the starting serve will serve the shuttlecock or \"bird\" across\\nthe net to the opposing team.\\nTHE BEGINNING SERVE IS ALWAYS UNDERHAND AND SERVED FROM THE RIGHT SIDE\\nOF THE COURT so you will need to situate your play to serve from this\\npoint. The serve also needs to be aimed to land diagonally from the\\nserve point so you will want the serve to end up across the net on the\\nleft side of the opposing teams court.\\nAfter the shuttlecock is served the match will remain in play sending\\nthe shuttle over the net with one hit per opposing team. If the shuttle\\nlands for any reason on the court of the team that did not serve a point\\nis awarded to the serving team.\\nYou can only score a point if you are the serving team. If the shuttle\\ncomes to rest on the court of the serving team the opponents have won\\nthe next serve and the chance to score a point by stopping play on the\\nopposite side of the court.\\nAs you rally the shuttle from one side of the net to the other you will\\nwant to do all possible to return it every time without a second hit or\\nthe shuttle landing on the court. Either of these will result in a point\\nfor the serving team or send the serve to the opposing team depending on\\nwhich side of the net the shuttle comes to rest.\\nOther ways that the serving team will score points is if the non-serving\\nteam hits the shuttle out of bounds on the other side of the net. If the\\nnon-serving team or player hits the shuttle over the net and out of the\\nmarked boundaries on the court the serving team gains a point. If the\\nserving team sends the shuttle over the net and out of the marked\\nboundaries the rally is stopped and the serve is then given to the\\nopposing team.\\nThe game of badminton is usually played in these sets of rallies to the\\nscore of 15. The first team or player to reach 15 points wins the match.\\nMost games according to official badminton instruction are played in\\ngames of three and the best two out of three games wins the match.\\nHowever the International Badminton Federation has adopted a new scoring\\nsystem called the Badminton 21 points scoring system.\\nWith the new scoring system eventually all badminton games will grow to\\nbe played in the new standard. The 21 points system has changed the\\nscoring system to the first team to reach 21 points wins the game. Every\\ntime a rally is won the rally winning team adds one point to their\\nscore.\\nIf there is an instance where the score becomes tied 20 to 20 the side\\nscoring the next 2 consecutive points will win the game. If the score\\nreaches 29 to 29 with no winner which ever team wins the 30th point will\\nwin the game.\\n\\n  ',\n",

Honestly there is much more to this wonderful sport! It is\\n  often thought of much like tennis and though it may look the same it is\\n  quite different in many respects.\\n  Some very important information to know about badminton is that it is a\\n  true sport. It is recognized nationally and through the Olympics. As\\n  with any other competitive sport there are defensive and offensive\\n  maneuvers that one must learn in order to play a competitive game of\\n  badminton.\\n  Badminton is also a sport that you MUST BE IN GOOD PHYSICAL SHAPE TO\\n  PLAY, especially given some of the opponents that you will encounter if\\n  you become serious about the sport. Other essential aspects of\\n  badminton that will be important to understand are about the equipment\\n  needed to play and other subtitles that will affect your decision of\\n  whether badminton is the right game for you.\\n  One of the essentials that many do not consider when looking at\\n  badminton for a new sport or hobby is that it is always played indoors.\\n  This may not seem important to some but if you are looking for a sport\\n  you will be enjoying out of doors then this is not it.\\n  Badminton is played indoors because of the light weight shuttlecock\\n  that is used in play. This is the item that is hit back and forth\\n  across the net. Because of the very light weight and shape of the\\n  shuttlecock, wind greatly affects the game of badminton and even a\\n  slight breeze can hinder play.\\n  BADMINTON IS ALSO A SPORT THAT USES EQUIPMENT THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO YOUR\\n  PLAY. Aside from having a shuttlecock, you will need a light weight\\n  badminton racket, a quality net and often you will want to have back up\\n  equipment pieces or extra of all of these.\\n  When learning to play badminton you will find that there are strategies\\n  for both the defensive and offensive side of the game. Because of this\\n  badminton is also a game that requires practice and thought to how you\\n  will challenge your opponent.\\n  There are a variety of trick shots or deceptive shots that will help to\\n  improve your game as well as hone your abilities to out play your\\n  opponent through the art of deception. Badminton essentials include all\\n  of these aspects and they are easy to find information on through\\n  articles and blogs on the Internet to in depth books that will bring a\\n  great amount of knowledge on how to practice and prepare yourself in\\n  this sport.\\n  Badminton is a sport that does require you to be in good physical\\n  condition. How good your condition must be will greatly depend on your\\n  intentions for playing. There are many people that play badminton\\n  merely as a hobby to get into shape, exercise or for stress relief. For\\n  these purposes you will need to be moderately healthy, with the ability\\n  to move across the court quickly to give your opponent a fair game.\\n  IF YOU ARE LOOKING INTO BADMINTON ON A MORE COMPETITIVE LEVEL SUCH AS\\n  PLAYING IN TOURNAMENTS OR EVEN PROFESSIONALLY YOU WILL NEED TO UP YOUR\\n  HEALTH CONDITION CONSIDERABLY. To play badminton professionally you\\n  will need to be in excellent condition and continue to shape your body\\n  as well as the way you mentally play this highly energetic sport.\\n  Players that are interested in playing competitively in tournaments and\\n  other arenas will do extensive conditioning, weight training, study of\\n  offense and defense, and practice their game to the point of perfection\\n  including their serves. Let's face it without practice in any\\n  competitive sport you will not rise to the occasion or in this case the\\n  game to out play your opponents.\\n\\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n  \",\n",

       " ['\\nBadminton Coaching Tips\\n\\nBadminton coaching tips is something which helps beginners and experts\\nin badminton to successfully master various aspects of badminton with\\nlittle difficulty, aided by their coaches or trainers, who themselves\\nmight have been excellent players in their days and who have sufficient\\nknowledge and insight regarding badminton.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| COACHING TIPS FROM YOUR COACH OR TRAINER IN BADMINTON ARE INVALUABLE  |\\n| because they are the ones who stand near you, watching your game day  |\\n| after day on court and during practice sessions. They are in a unique |\\n| position to analyze your weaknesses and drawbacks. They also have     |\\n| enough stakes in your success, which enable them to correct them      |\\n| promptly then and there. FOR WHEN THE WARD SUCCEEDS, IT IS THEIR      |\\n| SUCCESS.                                                              |\\n| For a beginner, serving is the first problem. Often, they try to      |\\n| serve and miss. It happens because they drop the shuttle and swing    |\\n| the racket at the same time. When in fact THEY SHOULD SWING THE       |\\n| RACKET AFTER THEY RELEASE THE SHUTTLE. Without understanding, they    |\\n| keep on swinging the racket a little before they release the shuttle, |\\n| missing again and again. A coach can correct this by arranging the    |\\n| serving sequence in order, numbering them and make the ward obey the  |\\n| order.                                                                |\\n| Similarly some players have difficulty in avoiding the backhand       |\\n| stroke. Incidentally, the backhand strokes are significantly weaker   |\\n| than the forehand strokes and must be avoided to the maximum. When    |\\n| playing across the head forehand stroke may offset inevitable,        |\\n| playing backhand. Good coaching tips can help overcome this problem   |\\n| for the player.                                                       |\\n| One more advantage in getting coaching tips is that different types   |\\n| of weaknesses are there for different age group players. For example, |\\n| under 12 players usually have trouble in playing rearcourt shots.     |\\n| Similarly, under 14 commonly have a weak backhand shot, under 16 have |\\n| weak around the head forehand shot and under 18 suffer from           |\\n| inadequate court coverage. The technical deficiencies involving all   |\\n| the above can only be rectified by coaching tips.                     |\\n| Similarly, court-covering skills is woefully lacking in beginners and |\\n| intermediate level players. They look at the professionals and wonder |\\n| at their court covering skills. They think they can never imagine     |\\n| attaining their speeds necessary for covering the court.              |\\n| But in reality, the coaching tips from the trainer or coach will make |\\n| them understand that IT IS THE MOMENTUM, NOT THE SPEED THAT SEPARATES |\\n| THEM FROM THE PROFESSIONALS. Coaching tips to cover all portions of   |\\n| the court from a central position will help them cover all the areas  |\\n| of the court better.                                                  |\\n| Also, flick serves are always a problem in beginners. They do not     |\\n| anticipate them and consequently miss them most of the time. Coaching |\\n| tips to correct it involve asking them to stand at the place from     |\\n| where they can lunge forward and reach a drop serve or take a couple  |\\n| of steps back easily to meet a high or flick serve.                   |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  ',\n",

They can be played   |\\n| on both forehand and backhand sides. Practicing your clears can       |\\n| improve your game to a great extent.                                  |\\n| Badminton drop shots are DELICATE SHOTS which when played with the    |\\n| right placement and timing can ensure you an upper hand in the game.  |\\n| They can be played on backhand as well as forehand sides too. The     |\\n| idea is to force the opponent to move to the front court so that the  |\\n| mid court and the back court remain free. Drop shots in badminton     |\\n| sports are of two types - slow drop shot and fast drop shot.          |\\n| A well executed smash shot is the DEADLIEST WEAPON that you can use   |\\n| on a badminton court. The power, speed, angle and trajectory of a     |\\n| smash shot will determine how difficult it is for your opponent to    |\\n| recover. A smash shot hit towards the downward direction with optimum |\\n| force is ideal.                                                       |\\n| Drives are shots which cross over the net FLATLY IN A HORIZONTAL      |\\n| TRAJECTORY. Drives are attacking shots that are used when the         |\\n| shuttlecock is too low for you to hit a smash. These shots can be     |\\n| played straight down the court or diagonally. They are used more in   |\\n| doubles games, where it is advisable to keep the shuttlecock at a low |\\n| height.                                                               |\\n| Badminton net play is an important area of the game which requires    |\\n| great amount of refinement. These are delicate shots which involve a  |\\n| SUDDEN CHANGE OF THE ANGLE OF THE RACQUET to confuse your opponent.   |\\n| Net shots are of three types - net shot, net kill and net lift.       |\\n| You can learn the techniques of badminton sports by working under a   |\\n| qualified coach or observing the skills of professional players. But  |\\n| there is no substitute for hard labor if you want to be good at it.   |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  ',\n",

       " ['\\n\\nCoaching Badminton Drills\\n\\nCoaching badminton drills are going to be one of the most important part\\nof your badminton training if you want to be a great badminton player.\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| These types of drills and good instruction on how to execute them are |\\n| often difficult to find. The reason they can be so hard to find is    |\\n| that you really need good step by step instruction for coaching       |\\n| badminton drills in order to do them correctly. If you are doing your |\\n| training drills incorrectly you could be doing more harm than good    |\\n| when trying to perfect your badminton game.                           |\\n| ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COACHING BADMINTON DRILLS YOU SHOULD LEARN  |\\n| INCLUDE IN YOUR PRACTICES WILL BE TO WORK ON FOOTWORK. Footwork is    |\\n| one of the best drills to begin with because if you can control your  |\\n| foot work you will have more control of where your shuttle will       |\\n| eventually end up. You of course will need to work on shuttle control |\\n| and swinging drills as well but we will start for now with footwork.  |\\n| Footwork drills will help you to add control to your movements on the |\\n| court as well as help you with control in learning and practicing     |\\n| with other badminton drills. The drills we will discuss here are      |\\n| going to be useful as we will cover the same basic footwork that is   |\\n| used in an actual match of badminton.                                 |\\n| The first footwork coaching drill that you will want to practice will |\\n| be moving to the baseline for a forehand swing. In this drill you     |\\n| will be positioned in the middle of the court in standby prepared for |\\n| your shot to approach. As you see the shuttle coming you will push    |\\n| off with the right leg and as you do so turn your body clockwise.     |\\n| Skip, using both your legs, to the shuttle and follow a forehand      |\\n| swing through at the baseline. You will then push off with both of    |\\n| your legs to go to the next shot coming.                              |\\n| Footwork is important in all your swings and the next coaching        |\\n| badminton drill is going to the baseline for an around the head shot. |\\n| Again here you will be positioned in the middle of the court and push |\\n| off with both legs as you see the shuttle approach. Turn your body so |\\n| that it is facing the oncoming shuttle, as you hit the shuttle you    |\\n| will then bring your right leg and right shoulder to the front and    |\\n| push off to prepare for the returned shuttle.                         |\\n| Moving to the net for a backhand and forehand are two important       |\\n| footwork drills that you will also need to learn. Moving to the net   |\\n| to use a backhand shot will require you to position yourself ready    |\\n| with your left leg behind your body. As you see the shuttle coming    |\\n| you will take a small step forward with the left leg and then lunge   |\\n| with the right as the final step before hitting the shuttle. Moving   |\\n| to the net for a forehand swing is very similar as you start in a     |\\n| ready stance, take a small step forward with your left leg and then   |\\n| lunge with your right as you swing for the shuttle.                   |\\n| After you have mastered the footwork for general returns you will     |\\n| want to learn how to position your lower body when receiving a        |\\n| forehand or backhand smash. Receiving a forehand smash will require   |\\n| you to lean your entire body to the right and lunge with your right   |\\n| leg, as you do this you will stretch out your racket hand and take    |\\n| the smash with a forehand swing. Receiving a backhand smash is for    |\\n| the most part the opposite. You will lean your entire body to the     |\\n| left as you do so you will want to turn your body and bring your      |\\n| right leg across as you lunge with the right leg you will stretch     |\\n| your racket hand out to take the backhand swing.                      |\\n| Side to side forehand smash footwork will require you to start with   |\\n| your body in the ready position. As you start the drill you will bend |\\n| both your knees to jump into the air in the direction of the forehand |\\n| side, be sure to jump with both your legs as far as you possibly can  |\\n| to the forehand side. This drill is very similar to the side to side  |\\n| around the head smash drill. You will start in the ready position and |\\n| bend both your knees preparing to jump. You will jump in the          |\\n| direction of the around the head side, again making sure to jump with |\\n| both your legs and as far as possible to the around the head          |\\n| direction.                                                            |\\n| Finally in the footwork coaching drills is the backhand footwork      |\\n| drill which will again require you to start in the ready position. As |\\n| you follow to where the shuttle will need to be hit you will move     |\\n| forward with your left leg keeping the right leg stretched to the     |\\n| back. After you have made your swing follow through comfortably and   |\\n| prepare for your next shot.                                           |\\n| All of these foot work badminton coaching drills will help you to     |\\n| perfect the rate at which you make it to the shuttle as well as the   |\\n| grace and speed you execute on the badminton courts. Practice them    |\\n| and you will see that the instruction here is simple and easy to      |\\n| follow, mostly these will be natural movements if you are an          |\\n| experienced badminton player, but ease does not mean that you can not |\\n| improve and practice is the best way to improve your game.            |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  ',\n",

       " [\"Similarities between Tennis and Badminton\\n\\nThis is nice to think of. On the one side is a high power sport where a\\nball much heavier than shuttle is used and graphite rackets are employed\\nto whack them to all corners.\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| On the other side is a feather touch shuttle played with gentle       |\\n| rackets in a much smaller court. Similarities between the two? I must |\\n| be kidding. But there are certain SIMILARITIES BETWEEN TENNIS AND     |\\n| BADMINTON, which we will start enumerating one by one.                |\\n| The first obvious similarity is both games use rackets, how much ever |\\n| different they are in looks and performance. Tennis strings are much  |\\n| stronger and thicker than badminton racket strings but why bother     |\\n| about the subtle difference in the face of such overwhelming          |\\n| similarity?                                                           |\\n| Sure enough, both games use nets in between players to challenge them |\\n| play their shots. Of course, badminton scores over tennis in this     |\\n| aspect as the net is tied at the height of 5 feet, much taller than   |\\n| tennis nets.                                                          |\\n| Now I can sense that you are becoming interested. Right, the next     |\\n| similarity between tennis and badminton is both games have men's      |\\n| singles, doubles, women's singles, doubles and mixed doubles.         |\\n| Although the women's events have less sex appeal in badminton thanks  |\\n| to the regulations in outfits, hopefully in future the regulations    |\\n| can become as lenient as the flapping skirts of women playing tennis. |\\n| Well, coming to the more serious issues, both the games feature in    |\\n| both OLYMPICS AND ASIAN GAMES and the badminton players vie with each |\\n| other to uphold the honor of their countries as much as their tennis  |\\n| counterparts.                                                         |\\n| In both games, players serve underhand. Now don't get me wrong.       |\\n| Although tennis players always serve overhand, they are permitted to  |\\n| serve underhand if they want to. Only they don't want to because, the |\\n| opponent will pummel it. In spite of the limitation and disadvantage, |\\n| tennis ace Michael Chang, afflicted by severe fatigue and cramps,     |\\n| served underhand to Ivan Lendl in a French open match on his match    |\\n| point...and won it!!!                                                 |\\n| In enumerating about the similarities between tennis and badminton,   |\\n| one cannot fail to mention that the major event for both these games  |\\n| happen to occur in England, THE WIMBLEDON AND ALL-ENGLAND             |\\n| respectively. Kudos to the Englishmen for keeping it so even in the   |\\n| postcolonial era.                                                     |\\n| Both badminton and tennis are played and followed all over the world, |\\n| albeit with different success and failure ratios. Western world rules |\\n| tennis and the eastern world rules badminton in general.              |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  \",\n",

       " [\"\\n  --\\n\\nFrom there it spread to other parts of Europe, Asia and the World.\\nToday, it's a popular sport worldwide, both at amateur and professional\\nlevels. The following article contains the 10 rules of badminton and\\nother regulations that you familiarize yourself with to play the sport.\\nBadminton is played with two single or two teams of two players each. It\\nis a racquet sport. The rectangular court is divided into two halves\\nwith a net in the centre. Unlike other racquet games like squash or\\ntennis badminton does not use a ball. It is played with a feathered\\nprojectile, which is called a SHUTTLECOCK.\\nShuttlecocks characteristically are light weight and are thereby\\naffected by the wind. Thus professional badminton is played indoors as\\neven the slightest breeze can effect the direction of the shuttlecock.\\nThe 10 RULES OF BADMINTON given below are valid for both professional\\nand amateur badminton games.\\nThe game involves the two opponents hitting the shuttlecock over the net\\ninto the other person's side. The rally ends when the shuttlecock\\ntouches the ground. Only one stroke is allowed to pass it over the net.\\nOne badminton match is made up of three games, of 21 points each.\\nProfessional badminton games are of five kinds: Men's singles, Men's\\ndoubles, Mixed doubles, Women's singles and Women's Doubles.\\nIn a badminton match, the court size for a single's game is 44 feet long\\nX 17 feet wide and for a doubles match it is 44 feet long X 20 feet\\nwide. The height of the net is 5 feet.\\nThe 10 rules of badminton are as follows:\\n1. A game starts with a coin toss. Whoever wins the toss gets to decide\\nwhether they would serve or receive first OR what side of the court they\\nwant to be on. The side losing the toss shall then exercise the\\nremaining choice.\\n2. At no time during the game should the player touch the net, with his\\nracquet or his body.\\n3. The shuttlecock should not be carried on or come to rest on the\\nracquet.\\n4. A player should not reach over the net to hit the shuttlecock.\\n5. A serve must carry cross court (diagonally) to be valid.\\n6. During the serve, a player should not touch any of the lines of the\\ncourt, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. During the serve the\\nshuttlecock should always be hit from below the waist.\\n7. A point is added to a player's score as and when he wins a rally.\\n8. A player wins a rally when he strikes the shuttlecock and it touches\\nthe floor of the opponent's side of the court or when the opponent\\ncommits a fault. The most common type of fault is when a player fails to\\nhit the shuttlecock over the net or it lands outside the boundary of the\\ncourt.\\n9. Each side can strike the shuttlecock only once before it passes over\\nthe net. Once hit, a player can't strike the shuttlecock in a new\\nmovement or shot.\\n10. The shuttlecock hitting the ceiling, is counted as a fault.\\nLearning and inculcating the 10 rules of badminton is the first step\\ntowards getting into the game. Besides these, it's a good idea to get to\\nknow more about the equipment laws, which govern what equipments can be\\nused - the design of the racquet, the weight and shape of the\\nshuttlecock (for correct speed). Surprisingly there is no rule for the\\nminimum height of the ceiling, but nevertheless, a low ceiling would be\\nproblematic.\\n\\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  \",\n",

Though, as far as quality is          |\\n| concerned, you may not be able to find a really funny joke, cartoon   |\\n| or picture so easily. But still there are a lot of badminton funny    |\\n| cartoons and pictures available on the Internet.                      |\\n| Those who have a little knowledge know that cartoons about the sport  |\\n| of badminton have a long history associated with them. One of the     |\\n| most famous and recorded badminton funny cartoons was published by    |\\n| PUNCH MAGAZINE IN THE YEAR 1854.                                      |\\n| Let\\'s come back to badminton jokes. One of the most simple and short  |\\n| badminton jokes could be \"BAD MINTON\". Badminton is unquestionably a  |\\n| very popular sport around the world. Perhaps there is something       |\\n| really funny in the name itself, e.g. there are many terms and        |\\n| accessories associated with the sport that make this sport a funny    |\\n| one, such as \"shuttlecock\", \"shuttle\",\"\"cock\", \"love all\", \"service   |\\n| over\" and \"change ends\" etc.                                          |\\n| Jokes are jokes; they can come in any form or type, so it all depends |\\n| upon who says and what, and in what circumstances. For example, it is |\\n| said that in order to score in badminton a player must place his cock |\\n| in his opponent\\'s court with thrust. It is really funny when it is    |\\n| generally said that in badminton a player may only handle the cock    |\\n| before serving or after scoring.                                      |\\n| I still remember, when a childhood friend of mine once said, \"If a    |\\n| player does not get the cock into his opponents court for any reason  |\\n| then he does not score and cannot try again until he has service      |\\n| again.\"                                                               |\\n| I am sure, everybody who in some form or other is related to          |\\n| badminton sport, knows that in badminton damaged cocks aren\\'t used as |\\n| this can cause irritation to the court surface. No doubt, courts are  |\\n| delicate so should be handled with utmost care and delicacy.          |\\n| Therefore it is sometimes said that rubber covers (of course in       |\\n| badminton) are highly advised for safety as they are about 99% less   |\\n| likely to damage the court.                                           |\\n| Wise people say beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. So true,     |\\n| especially when it comes to jokes. There are many people who may not  |\\n| laugh even at decent jokes, whereas there are people who would start  |\\n| bursting at some simple lines. If you don\\'t believe then see these    |\\n| lines:                                                                |\\n| \"Courts with worn or damaged patches should not be used for at least  |\\n| two weeks.\"                                                           |\\n| \"We don\\'t need new balls in badminton.\"                               |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  ',\n",

       " ['\\nBadminton Hand Signals\\n\\nIn any sports that we see today, participants and game supervisors use\\nhand signals to communicate with each other, regulate the game and keep\\ntrack of scores. The same is followed in badminton, which we may name as\\nbadminton hand signals.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| In this era of globalization, it is often difficult to communicate    |\\n| verbally during a game, particularly by the game supervisors. It is   |\\n| because the players\\' attention is primarily riveted to the game.      |\\n| Moreover the players come from different parts of the world. Some of  |\\n| them may not know the language used and others may have difficulty in |\\n| following the accent, even if they know the language. Above all, when |\\n| the crowd is excited, it is often difficult to adjust scores and      |\\n| manage the game properly if verbal communication alone is used to     |\\n| regulate the game and keep track of scores.                           |\\n| Badminton hand signals are used precisely to overcome this            |\\n| difficulty. In badminton, besides participating players, there is a   |\\n| Referee who is in overall charge of the game, an Umpire, a service    |\\n| judge and a line judge. All these people use BADMINTON HAND SIGNALS   |\\n| to regulate the game.                                                 |\\n| Hand signals followed by the umpires are -                            |\\n| RAISING HIS RIGHT HAND STRAIGHT ABOVE HIS HEAD. When misconduct       |\\n| sufficient enough to apply rule 16.8 is reported about a player or    |\\n| the umpire witnesses it, he should call the player. He should do the  |\\n| above hand signal and say,\"......................(player\\'s name),     |\\n| warning for misconduct\"                                               |\\n| The service judges are responsible for monitoring whether a player    |\\n| serves correctly as per rules. Hand signals followed by the service   |\\n| judges are -                                                          |\\n| RAISING THE RIGHT ARM IN FRONT SLIGHTLY, FLEXING THE ELBOW AND        |\\n| KEEPING THE PALM VERTICALLY FACING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. It is done |\\n| to indicate that the shaft of the racket when hitting the shuttle was |\\n| not below the level of the wrist holding the racket and/or the shaft  |\\n| of the racket was not facing downwards when hitting the shuttle       |\\n| during serving.                                                       |\\n| KEEPING THE PALM HORIZONTALLY FACING DOWNWARDS AT THE LEVEL OF THE    |\\n| ABDOMEN, FOLLOWED BY MOVING IT TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT BELOW THE LEVEL  |\\n| OF WAIST. It is done to convey that the shuttle, as a whole was not   |\\n| under the level of the waist while it was struck during serving.      |\\n| EXTENDING THE RIGHT LEG AND POINTING THE HAND TOWARDS THE FOOT. It is |\\n| done to indicate that one or both feet were not in the service court  |\\n| or remains constant till the serve was completed.                     |\\n| RESTING THE PALM OF THE RIGHT HAND ON RIGHT SIDE OF THE ABDOMEN,      |\\n| KEEPING THE PALM FACING THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BODY, WITH FINGERS       |\\n| POINTING DOWNWARDS AND POINTING THE FINGERS OF THE LEFT HAND TO THE   |\\n| PALM OF THE RIGHT HAND WITH THE PALM OF THE LEFT HAND FACING THE      |\\n| ABDOMEN. It is done to show that the first point of contact with the  |\\n| shuttle was not the base of the shuttle.                              |\\n| Hand signals shown by line judges include -                           |\\n| EXTENDING BOTH HANDS HORIZONTALLY TO THE SIDES OF THE BODY. It is to  |\\n| indicate the shuttle landed outside.                                  |\\n| POINTING THE HAND TO THE LINE. To show that the shuttle has fallen    |\\n| inside correctly.                                                     |\\n| CLOSING BOTH EYES WITH HANDS.

Badminton is one of the fastest racket sports |\\n| and the fastest racket shot has been recorded in badminton.           |\\n| The average badminton match may not last as long as a tennis match,   |\\n| but the average time that the shuttle is in play is significantly     |\\n| much longer than the tennis ball. Also, the average badminton rally   |\\n| lasts much longer than in tennis, and the number of shots taken in a  |\\n| second, especially in a game of doubles, is many more than in tennis. |\\n| The on-court movements in a game of badminton are also more, with a   |\\n| player completing nearly a mile on the court. Also you are on your    |\\n| toes all the time, constantly changing positions and lunging and      |\\n| exploding in different directions to retrieve and return the ball.    |\\n| The game also involves intense mental concentration, akin to chess,   |\\n| continually anticipating and pre-empting your opponent's moves. From  |\\n| the health freak's perspective too, badminton is a sport, providing a |\\n| complete overall workout for the body and mind.                       |\\n| Badminton is certainly the most participation intensive racket game.  |\\n| Over the past decade, badminton has outstripped tennis in terms of    |\\n| increase in popularity, at least in the rest of the world. But this   |\\n| fact is belied by the comparatively miniscule television coverage     |\\n| that the game receives.                                               |\\n| The media and the sponsors, apparently, still do not perceive the     |\\n| game as popular. One would expect this attitude to affect the         |\\n| popularity of the game, but in contrast the number of people who are  |\\n| taking to the sport is steadily increasing. To the truly discerning   |\\n| sports fan, the game advertises itself.                               |\\n| The world has realized this, where badminton has grown in popularity  |\\n| by leaps and bounds. This is one game, which is dominated by the non- |\\n| white people. We don't know if this is one reason why the game is     |\\n| being cold-shouldered in certain countries, where the average fan is  |\\n| still besotted with other sports. WITHOUT DETRACTING FROM THE GLORY   |\\n| OF THESE OTHER GAMES, BADMINTON IS, BY NO MEANS INFERIOR TO THEM.     |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  \",\n",

       " [\"Badminton Logos\\n\\n\\nBadminton Logos\\n\\nA logo is a graphic element a symbol or an icon and in combination with\\nits logotype, arranged in a particular way it, becomes the identifying\\nmark of a company, group, brand or forum etc. The major function of a\\nlogo in fact is to produce an IMMEDIATE IDENTIFICATION.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| Logos become an indispensable part of the identity of the brand or    |\\n| group they represent. The inverted Y inside a circle for Mercedes,    |\\n| the black horse for Ferrari, the Nike swoosh, the Adidas three        |\\n| stripes are some unforgettable logos of our times.                    |\\n| There are three basic parts of a logo - THE LOGOTYPE (LETTER MARK),   |\\n| THE ICON (SYMBOL), AND THE SLOGAN. It's essential that your logo      |\\n| should be distinct and easily distinguishable to avoid confusion.     |\\n| Most of the companies, corporations, brands use logos these days.     |\\n| Thus it has become to recognize a logo without its name. But there    |\\n| are a few logos, like the Red Cross, the red ribbon of the Coca Cola  |\\n| logo which work against language barriers and countries because of    |\\n| their immense popularity and wide spread usage.                       |\\n| Logo designing is a significant area in the field of graphic design   |\\n| in today's world. The logo is seen as the embodiment of a group. Some |\\n| of things that should be kept in mind when designing a logo are - be  |\\n| practical, avoid using too many colors, work with design              |\\n| infringements, avoid using complex images or photographs of a live    |\\n| person, refrain from using images which might offend sensibilities,   |\\n| while creating the logo use vector graphics which would help adjust   |\\n| the size of the image without losing its basic functionality.         |\\n| Badminton logos can be of two types - first the ones that REPRESENT   |\\n| THE SPORT ITSELF. 'A white stick figure holding a racquet and aiming  |\\n| at a shuttlecock' is the Olympic logo for badminton, for example. The |\\n| second ones are the badminton logos which REPRESENT VARIOUS TEAMS,    |\\n| TOURNAMENTS ETC.                                                      |\\n| Teams adopt logos which become representatives of the team, the head  |\\n| of a bull for Chicago Bulls for example. Team logos bind team members |\\n| and induce team spirit. The team logo is either embroidered or        |\\n| printed on the uniforms of each player.                               |\\n| In a single player game, players often sport their country's flag     |\\n| instead of any other logos. Many a times, in case of professional     |\\n| badminton circuit, there are sports goods companies which sponsor     |\\n| players. These sponsorship contracts require the players to sport the |\\n| logo of the company on their uniforms.                                |\\n| Some years back, the Indonesian Badminton Association, for example,   |\\n| got into a hitch with the sport's goods manufacturer Yonex, and was   |\\n| facing a compensation claim of $255,000, as the players did not wear  |\\n| the standard issued uniforms of the Yonex Company at a practice match |\\n| in West Java.                                                         |\\n| The contract however required them to wear Yonex shirts and use their |\\n| racquets in all matches in Indonesia and overseas. Yonex paid about a |\\n| million dollars in sponsorship to the Indonesian Badminton            |\\n| Association.                                                          |\\n| With graphic designing becoming a thriving profession there is a wide |\\n| range of designing firms available to cater to your individual needs. |\\n| All you need to do is to clue them about the nature of your group/    |\\n| team and the various contexts in which the logo might be used.        |\\n| Badminton logos for example would adorn the player's uniforms, would  |\\n| be used for publicity, and for identification during tournaments. A   |\\n| logo should ideally be transferable from one context to another       |\\n| without losing its significance and viability.                        |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  \",\n",

       " [\"\\n\\nBadminton Fitness\\n\\nBadminton fitness is pivotal in helping a player to achieve high\\nstandards in badminton and play without fatigue hour after hour.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| Badminton players need to be more fit than tennis players in that the |\\n| time the ball remain in play, average length of rallies and distance  |\\n| traveled by players during the game are all significantly higher in   |\\n| badminton. In other words, THE ENDURANCE LEVEL OF BADMINTON PLAYERS   |\\n| SHOULD BE VERY HIGH.                                                  |\\n| Also it is worthwhile remembering that badminton is significantly     |\\n| faster than tennis, so the player needs to be in peak fitness to run, |\\n| stretch, dive, bend, jump and reach the birdie with lightning quick   |\\n| reflexes and body balance. Speed is the key to winning.               |\\n| FOR BADMINTON FITNESS TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE METHODS ADOPTED TO IMPROVE |\\n| FITNESS SHOULD BE SPECIFIC TO BADMINTON. For example, there is no     |\\n| need to strengthen jaw muscles for badminton, as it serves no useful  |\\n| purpose in developing the playing skills of any badminton player.     |\\n| Specific badminton fitness involves strengthening of the wrist,       |\\n| elbows, shoulders, neck, chest, abdomen, back, thighs, knees and      |\\n| ankles. Because these are the body areas that are actively involved   |\\n| in playing badminton. Consequently, strengthening these areas by      |\\n| specific exercises improves the fitness and strength of the player,   |\\n| enabling him to endure better during play.                            |\\n| THE SECOND IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ACHIEVING BADMINTON FITNESS IS THAT IT |\\n| SHOULD BE PROGRESSIVE IN NATURE. That is, the fitness of the player   |\\n| should be gradually improved by gradual upgrading of the exercise     |\\n| employed.                                                             |\\n| For example, let us consider that a badminton player's on court       |\\n| endurance is going to be improved by exercise. For the first few      |\\n| days, the player should be instructed to jog in casual speed for up   |\\n| to 10 minutes. Once he is able to do that without any difficulty, he  |\\n| must be allowed to do it in peak jogging speed.                       |\\n| After attaining the second level also, the duration should be         |\\n| gradually increased, say 15, 20, 25 minutes. By doing so, his fitness |\\n| is gradually upgraded without subjecting him to risk of training      |\\n| injuries and undue fatigue.                                           |\\n| Even with the above methods of specific and progressive badminton     |\\n| fitness training, any player is going to feel stale on repeatedly     |\\n| doing the above. He consequently looses interest, which may affect    |\\n| his performance at the subconscious level.                            |\\n| TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM, VARIATION IN BADMINTON FITNESS TRAINING IS  |\\n| TO BE PRACTICED. Variations should attempt to make the player staying |\\n| focused and interested in training sessions and at the same time help |\\n| to improve his fitness day after day.                                 |\\n| For instance, the player can be instructed to do jogging, skipping,   |\\n| hopping or swimming in different days to keep his interest in         |\\n| training alive. If he starts enjoying his training sessions,          |\\n| naturally it will translate into better on court performance.         |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  \",\n",

In the past there were many players who   |\\n| complaint about lack of necessary help and quality assistance from    |\\n| their coaches.                                                        |\\n| And, sometimes simply due to their poor economic conditions many      |\\n| players weren't able to join this great sport. Apart from moral and   |\\n| monetary support, they need expert tips and guidance in order to gain |\\n| proficiency in this game. We'll share some of the badminton tips      |\\n| here:                                                                 |\\n| One of the most important techniques in the net play area is the      |\\n| Lunge. Here are some of the main technical aspects:                   |\\n| AIM:The objective should be crystal clear. The aim is to get the      |\\n| shuttle back in to the court and trap the opponent down at the net.   |\\n| This will force the opponent to lift the shuttle up and short,        |\\n| thereby offering you an opportunity to attack.                        |\\n| TECHNIQUE: The most preferred method is to approach the net and Lunge |\\n| aggressively. The racket leg must work like a brake to your movement. |\\n| This act will produce the required force thereby generating the       |\\n| stroke with a minimum amount of racket head movement. The focus must  |\\n| be given on reaching out and taking the shuttle within the minimum    |\\n| possible time.                                                        |\\n| This will facilitate you to get the shuttle over the net and get back |\\n| in to the play close to the net on the other side. When playing the   |\\n| shot, it is important to face the racket parallel to the floor. Grip  |\\n| the racket handle lightly in the fingers. You must experiment with    |\\n| your grip to get this movement.                                       |\\n| However, it is also necessary to impart some spin on the shuttle and  |\\n| making it 'tumble'. YOU MAY MOVE THE RACKET HEAD SLIGHTLY IN AN OUTER |\\n| MOTION TO INCREASE THE TUMBLE ACTION. LIFTING THE RACKET HEAD         |\\n| slightly will maximize the effect.                                    |\\n| PRACTICE: The best way to practice is to work with a friend. To       |\\n| practice the technique, the feeder should stand on the service line   |\\n| and feed shuttles to the net both underarm and overarm. This mimics   |\\n| the shuttle play to the net in a game.                                |\\n| Top tips for beginners:                                               |\\n| - WARM-UP: Preparing the body well prior to the game is important.    |\\n| Hence, you need to indulge in a gentle jog or skipping to warm-up     |\\n| your body. Once your body is warm, stretch the major muscle groups    |\\n| concentrating on legs, back and shoulders.                            |\\n| - PRACTICE THE GRIP: Focus on the grip when choosing a racket. If you |\\n| have small hands, small grips are ideal and vice-versa. Concentrate   |\\n| on a relaxed grip when holding the racket. You can excel in forehand  |\\n| and backhand shots with the help of a flexible wrist.                 |\\n| - SHUTTLE: The shuttle you choose should not wobble.                  |\\n| - BASE POSITION: Returning to a central base position is a good       |\\n| decision.                                                             |\\n| - PLAY INDOORS: Find a proper court to practice.                      |\\n| - BE PREPARED: Badminton is an unpredictable game and you require     |\\n| moving in any direction within a certain period of time. So know your |\\n| body limits.                                                          |\\n| - STRATEGY: Make a game plan. It would be advisable to discover your  |\\n| opponents' weakness.                                                  |\\n| - CROSS-TRAIN: Involve in physical activities that would increase     |\\n| your flexibility such as Brisk Walking and Jogging.                   |\\n| - COOL-DOWN: Once you are over with your practice, end with a         |\\n| cool-down session. This may include a gentle walk and light           |\\n| stretching.                                                           |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  \",\n",

If a player doesn't have |\\n| the stamina and the endurance that is really required in Badminton,   |\\n| he can lose lots of points due to fatigue.                            |\\n| Jogging can also be considered as PART OF THE WARMING UP SESSIONS for |\\n| a player's badminton training regime and before a badminton match. It |\\n| is normally done after the stretching. It helps to condition you to   |\\n| suit the badminton hall's environment because different hall has      |\\n| different types of environment.                                       |\\n| It also helps to SETTLE DOWN MENTALLY AND REDUCE THE NERVOUSNESS OF   |\\n| THE PLAYER before the match begins. Top players normally jog around 5 |\\n| minutes before his match starts in every tournament.                  |\\n| Other than used for the warming up sessions, jogging is also often    |\\n| used as part of the training sessions. The trainees normally do       |\\n| intensive jogging to raise their endurance level so that when they    |\\n| are in the game, they can sustain the tough and physically demanding  |\\n| side of things.                                                       |\\n| By consistently doing intensive jogging, it helps to strengthen your  |\\n| legs so that you can do more drills that capitalize more on speed     |\\n| such as fast shadow, shuttle control, multi shuttle drills and etc.   |\\n| Without the presence of the strong legs, you won't be able to play a  |\\n| high quality badminton game.                                          |\\n| Jogging helps to strengthen the legs by consistently moving in a fast |\\n| pace. UPHILL JOGGING IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE EXERCISES TO        |\\n| STRENGTHEN THE LEG'S STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE LEVEL.                    |\\n| Your agility can also be improved. JOGGING HELPS TO STABILIZE THE     |\\n| FOOTWORK so that players won't stumble all over the court to retrieve |\\n| their opponent's shots. How often have you been in this situation     |\\n| whereby the shuttle has fallen a fraction out of your reach even      |\\n| though you know it's going to land there? If you had been able to     |\\n| turn or move to the shuttle a bit faster, you could have reached it.  |\\n| Jogging can be used as an addition to a player agility exercises such |\\n| as skipping, hopping and etc. I would highly recommend you to jog in  |\\n| small and fast steps. TRY TO STAY ON YOUR TOES OR ON THE BALLS OF     |\\n| YOUR FEET WHILE JOGGING.                                              |\\n| Sprinting in badminton is chiefly done to increase the speed of your  |\\n| court coverage. Many players have difficulty to keep up with the      |\\n| speed of the game due to the lack of speed itself. BY HAVING SPEED,   |\\n| IT CAN CREATE AN ADVANTAGE BY ENHANCING A PLAYER'S ANTICIPATION.      |\\n| Anticipation is referring to a condition where the shots are          |\\n| unexpectedly taken much earlier. It has a high percentage of          |\\n| finishing the rally. Speed increases the footwork abilities to be     |\\n| able to anticipate shots.                                             |\\n| In the modern Badminton games, speed plays a major role to win a      |\\n| game. Why is it so? Because most badminton players in the world goes  |\\n| for speed and power to win the game. Speed and Power was introduced   |\\n| by Rudy Hartono of Indonesia which had won the All England title for  |\\n| the record of 8 times. Without the presence of speed, you will have   |\\n| difficulty to raise your game to another level.                       |\\n| The right way to do the sprinting is to sprint on your toes. It is    |\\n| good for the leg to have lesser contact to the ground so that players |\\n| can create stronger legs. Usually SPRINTING IS DONE AT THE END OF THE |\\n| TRAINING PROGRAM so that the trainees can build up their mental       |\\n| strength when they sprint with exhaustion creating the best effect.   |\\n| The very common method used by top player is sprinting up the hill.   |\\n| Sprinting uphill will strengthen the legs and raise their endurance   |\\n| level because it demands a lot of physical and mental fitness. For    |\\n| the record there are some good example of Top players that often      |\\n| sprints up the hill such as Lin Dan (World Champion 2006), Mohd Hafiz |\\n| Hashim (2003 all England champion), Lee chong wei (2006 commonwealth  |\\n| games champion) and other players as well.                            |\\n| All these jogging and sprinting methods will definitely improve your  |\\n| game and fitness. Most importantly, it will also bring your game up   |\\n| to the next level.                                                    |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       " [\"\\nBadminton Training Using Squash Racket\\n\\nBadminton is a great game to play, really enjoyable and it is also a\\ngood exercise. Some of us play badminton for fun, during their leisure\\ntime while others take it more seriously, and go for badminton training.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| There are many different types of ways to train up your badminton     |\\n| skills. Today, I am going to focus more on training up your power.    |\\n| There are many ways to increase the strength of a badminton player's  |\\n| shot. One of the most common ways used is BY TRAINING WITH A SQUASH   |\\n| RACKET                                                                |\\n| Why use a squash racket? Well the answer to that question is          |\\n| simple... The grip size of the squash racket is similar to that of a  |\\n| badminton racket, unlike the tennis racket where its grip size is a   |\\n| little different to that of the badminton racket.                     |\\n| Using a squash racket for training will make a player's SMASH         |\\n| STRONGER. To illustrate this, Martial Art students will tie something |\\n| heavy on their legs, like stone, metal or sandbags while they train   |\\n| as this will help them to produce and execute a more powerful kick.   |\\n| The squash racket training works in the same way as this.             |\\n| Using a squash racket also trains a player's wrist to be more         |\\n| flexible. As the grip size of the squash racket is similar to the     |\\n| grip size of the badminton racket, players can do many exercises      |\\n| involving wrist work such as wrist rotation, backhand, forehand,      |\\n| drive and etc...                                                      |\\n| If a player uses a tennis racket to do this, it will make their wrist |\\n| stiff because of its thick grip. The squash racket training is also   |\\n| part of a badminton player's warm up. Normally, most players will     |\\n| take a few swings on the squash racket as a warm up before stepping   |\\n| onto the court.                                                       |\\n| By doing this, you will feel that the badminton racket is much        |\\n| lighter and easier to swing during trainings and even competitions.   |\\n| It will give you a slight advantage. When a squash racket is used for |\\n| training, it will not stiffen a player's wrist.                       |\\n| By doing other weight trainings, players wrist might become stiffer   |\\n| if it was done too many times or too often. However, players can do   |\\n| the squash racket training everyday WITHOUT THE FEAR THAT THEIR WRIST |\\n| WILL BECOME STIFF as it is like training with a heavy badminton       |\\n| racket. It also prevents players from injuring their wrist as by      |\\n| doing this training, a player's wrist not only gets stronger, but     |\\n| also more flexible.                                                   |\\n| But if you are just starting out on the game, it is not advisable to  |\\n| train with the squash racket right away because it can cause injury.  |\\n| This is because you might not be used to the heavy weight of the      |\\n| squash racket. Well, I am sure that this will help you in your game,  |\\n| and all the best in your badminton career.                            |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  \",\n",

The only break that\\n  the Badminton World Federation will take from organizing this event\\n  yearly is to not schedule the Badminton World Championships every four\\n  years.

       " ['\\n\\nFun Badminton Drills\\n\\nYou know, practicing and learning badminton need not be necessarily\\nboring. There are fun badminton drills by which you can learn badminton\\nin a comfortable manner.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| FUN BADMINTON DRILLS ARE THE COMPLACENT, NON-COMPETITIVE WAY OF       |\\n| IMPROVING YOUR BADMINTON SKILLS. At the same time, fun badminton      |\\n| drills can also be used to improve camaraderie between same club      |\\n| members, as each drill requires co-operation between participants.    |\\n| Fun badminton drills can be utilized to improve all the badminton     |\\n| shots, be it clear, lift, drop or smash. Similarly, fun badminton     |\\n| drills can significantly improve the court covering skills from       |\\n| baseline to net or between right and left sidelines.                  |\\n| Now let us discuss some simple fun badminton drills. Remember, fun    |\\n| badminton drills have no rules and regulations and you can devise     |\\n| your own fun badminton drills depending on which shot or aspect of    |\\n| the game you want to improve.                                         |\\n| IMPROVING CLEARING, SAME SIDE OF THE COURT                            |\\n| In this, players A and B, face each other on the same side of the     |\\n| court, standing near the doubles service line in the back of the      |\\n| court. Player A clears to player B, and player B in turn clears to    |\\n| player A. Each should practice clearing drawing an imaginary circle   |\\n| around them, or just within one-foot movement on all sides in         |\\n| practicing clearing.                                                  |\\n| IMPROVING CROSS-COURT CLEARING                                        |\\n| In this, players A and B face each other from the opposite sides of   |\\n| the court standing diagonally. Player A clears to player B who in     |\\n| turn clears it to player A. The same fun badminton drill is repeated  |\\n| after changing to the other same side of the court. By this, both     |\\n| left to right and right to left cross-court clearing can be mastered. |\\n| To make cross court clearing more effective and dynamic, both players |\\n| A and B can clear the shuttle to the opponents unoccupied corner,     |\\n| each time running to meet the shuttle and clearing it.                |\\n| By the same method, standing near the net, player A can drop to       |\\n| player B, Player B in turn dropping it again to player A. Initially   |\\n| this can be done with both players standing opposite to each other on |\\n| the same side. Then it can be practiced cross-court and finally both  |\\n| players can proceed to running and cross-court dropping.              |\\n| To master lifting, player A stands near the net and player B stands   |\\n| near the baseline, initially on the same side. Player B drops to      |\\n| player A, and player A lifts it to player B. Then the lifting and     |\\n| dropping is practiced cross-court and finally the running element is  |\\n| also included, as we have seen in clearing and dropping.              |\\n| Similar fun badminton drills can be adopted to master driving and     |\\n| smashing skills in three stages like 1) same side 2) cross court and  |\\n| 3) cross court and running as explained above.                        |\\n| FUN BADMINTON DRILLS CAN ALSO BE IN THE FORM OF MOCK DOUBLES GAME.    |\\n| Here, whoever is committing a mistake makes way for another new       |\\n| player to participate in the game.                                    |\\n| This is very useful when many players are there and the practicing    |\\n| court facilities are very limited. As players keep on changing on     |\\n| every point scored or lost, everyone gets an equal opportunity to     |\\n| participate and refine his or her skills.                             |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  ',\n",

       " [\"\\n\\nThe Importance of Mental Toughness\\n\\nMany Badminton players are good in the physical aspect but not tough\\nenough MENTALLY. A badminton player can have all the fitness, power,\\nagility and skills but without the presence of mental toughness, he or\\nshe can be affected mentally anytime, anywhere.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| Marathon runners are good examples. Normally most of the marathon     |\\n| runners reach their stamina limits in the last 12 KM over 42 KM. But  |\\n| their strong mental ability allows them to keep running at the same   |\\n| pace to finish the race. Some runners even increase their speed to    |\\n| finish the race although they are already exhausted.                  |\\n| Marathon runners call this method 'HITTING THE WALL', meaning pushing |\\n| to the limit. Even the legendary Tan Yee Khan of Malaysia uses the    |\\n| method of 'hitting the wall'. This method should be applied by        |\\n| badminton players who aspire to go one step further in the game.      |\\n| Whether it is during the game or training, players should keep        |\\n| focusing and pushing their body to the limit.                         |\\n| A match could take a rather long time to end. A good badminton player |\\n| or in other words an 'established badminton player' will not go down  |\\n| without a fight and should be able to keep their pace and the         |\\n| accuracy of their shots until the very last point in the game no      |\\n| matter how long they have played. This is where MENTAL TOUGHNESS      |\\n| plays a big role.                                                     |\\n| You can be a very skillful player and fit player but if you meet an   |\\n| opponent who has a much higher level of stamina and fighting spirits, |\\n| you will very likely lose the match if without the ability to push    |\\n| yourself when you are exhausted. There are plenty of instances        |\\n| whereby players are not strong enough mentally and emotionally, lost  |\\n| focus because of tiredness and gave up easily in the game.            |\\n| Sometimes you can be leading far ahead in the game like reaching game |\\n| points or match points and you are already thinking about victory.    |\\n| This should not be a habit of a badminton player because you might    |\\n| lose the game if you meet a player with great fighting spirits. You   |\\n| maybe be leading 14-0 or 19-10 but no matter how far you lead, you    |\\n| still have to stay focus until the game is over.                      |\\n| A good case in point would be the game that featured Hafiz Hashim and |\\n| Lee Hyun ll in the quarter finals of the 2006 DOHA Asian Games. Hafiz |\\n| was leading 19-10 at one stage in the first set, but could not stay   |\\n| focus and lost the set 22-20 in the end. He could not recover from    |\\n| this set back in the second set and lost the tie. Lee Hyun ll showed  |\\n| his MENTAL TOUGHNESS AND FIGHTING SPIRITS in this instance.           |\\n| A good player should always possess the 'NEVER SAY DIE' attitude even |\\n| if their opponents are leading by a huge margin just as Lee Hyun ll   |\\n| has shown in the Asian Games. Another good case in point would be the |\\n| game in between Lee Chong Wei and Lin Dan during the Malaysia Open    |\\n| 2006.                                                                 |\\n| Lin Dan was already leading 20-13 in the rubber game and this was a   |\\n| really difficult situation for Lee Chong Wei because one mistake is   |\\n| enough to cost him the match. But he handled the pressure well and    |\\n| showed a greater desire to win, slowly clawing back in to the game.   |\\n| Finally, he won that game 22-20 and surprised the whole world.        |\\n| Mental toughness can also give you an edge like FOCUSING ON THE MATCH |\\n| no matter what is happening around, keeping you calm and cool in the  |\\n| court. Having mental toughness is having a high EQ (emotional         |\\n| intelligence). Many incidents, good or bad, can happen during a match |\\n| outside or inside the court. For example, players can be              |\\n| psychologically affected by bad line calls, umpires decisions or      |\\n| insulted by the audience.                                             |\\n| There were cases of top players which were emotionally affected such  |\\n| as the case in one of the game which featured Taufik Hidayat in an    |\\n| Indonesian local tournament. He was insulted by an audience that      |\\n| directed harsh words at him. Taufik then runs up to the audience      |\\n| chair and confronted him.                                             |\\n| During Thomas cup 2002 Finals in Guangzhou and 2002 Busan Asian Games |\\n| he fell prey again to his emotionally vulnerability caused by the     |\\n| umpire's decisions and bad line calls which led him to lose the game. |\\n| In the 2006 HK open, he walked out of a semifinal game against Lin    |\\n| Dan because of a bad line call. No doubt he is a very good player,    |\\n| but if he could just control his emotions a bit better, he can be one |\\n| of the all-time greats.                                               |\\n| In many cases, players without much exposure are easily intimidated   |\\n| by the situation on hand and were not able to play their usual game.  |\\n| Mental toughness is needed to overcome all the fear with a 'nothing   |\\n| to lose', 'give everything you got' mentality. When fear is overcome, |\\n| the confidence will be there to win the game. You need to keep        |\\n| THINKING POSITIVELY in the game, no matter what happens.              |\\n| Badminton players should be equally strong, physically and mentally.  |\\n| Mental toughness will determine your success as a BADMINTON PLAYER    |\\n| and will help you attain consistent achievements.                     |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  \",\n",

       " [\"\\nBadminton Singles: Different Styles of Play\\n\\nIn the game of badminton singles, there are three main styles or\\npatterns of play. The fast and aggressive style players, the deceptive\\nstroke players and the straightforward, defensive style players.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| For the FAST AND AGGRESSIVE STYLE, most of the shots played are       |\\n| smashes, fast drop shots and net shots, attacking lobs, more low      |\\n| services than high services, quick low pushes/flicks to the backcourt |\\n| from the net and fast pace footwork on the court.                     |\\n| For the DECEPTIVE STROKE PLAYERS, there are more high services to the |\\n| baseline than low services, the lobs are more angled and deep, the    |\\n| drop shots are deceptively played and they drop nearer the net. The   |\\n| net shots are sharper and more deceptive but are not played as fast   |\\n| as the attacking pattern of play. Most of the strokes they play are   |\\n| deceptive strokes to trick and slow down their opponent.              |\\n| Moreover, the defenses of players who play this style are usually     |\\n| better and more reliable. Their push shots to the back are more       |\\n| angled and deceptive. This pattern of play requires less smashes and  |\\n| the movements of deceptive players are smoother and steadier, with    |\\n| better court craft.                                                   |\\n| For the STRAIGHTFORWARD AND DEFENSIVE STYLE, most of the shots are    |\\n| plain and simple as opposed to being deceptive. Most of the services  |\\n| are high and deep on to the backcourt, the net shots are not tricky   |\\n| but simple and very few cross-court net shots. The drop shots are     |\\n| sharp but not as fast as the attacking pattern of play.               |\\n| In this playing style, the main purpose is to wear the opponent down  |\\n| by playing consistently simple effective shots, making very few       |\\n| mistakes. The players that are categorized in this type of play       |\\n| normally have higher and stronger stamina because they are used to    |\\n| the long rallies.                                                     |\\n| Nearly all top players play a combination of two styles with one      |\\n| style dominating, such as Zhao Jian hua, combining effectively the    |\\n| attacking style with deceptive stroke play. Foo Kok Keong, Ong Ewe    |\\n| Hock and Ardy Wiranata played a straight forward, defensive style.    |\\n| They sometimes resort to fast attacking style.                        |\\n| Rudy Hartono was a fast attacking player. P. Gopichand is mainly a    |\\n| deceptive stroke player who sometimes uses the attacking style of     |\\n| play. Susi Susanti was a standard defensive and straightforward style |\\n| badminton singles player.                                             |\\n| Nowadays, many players like to play the fast attacking style which    |\\n| was introduced by Rudy Hartono with lots of jumping smashes and       |\\n| attacking lobs. Most of the aspiring young players of today also      |\\n| usually follow or try to imitate their idols or go with the trend     |\\n| because they believe that they can apply it to their badminton        |\\n| singles game to win matches.                                          |\\n| You shall always remember that your idols are individuals too and if  |\\n| you want to be a champion like them, you must believe and have        |\\n| confidence in your individuality.                                     |\\n| TO FIND OUT WHICH STYLE SUITS YOUR BADMINTON SINGLES GAME, YOU CAN    |\\n| ASK YOURSELF A FEW QUESTIONS SUCH AS:                                 |\\n| * Do I have a good temper and emotional intelligence to play this     |\\n| type of game?                                                         |\\n| * Am I the impatient aggressive type who takes risks? A temperament   |\\n| more suited to the attacking style.                                   |\\n| * Or am I the hardworking type who enjoys winning opponents using     |\\n| long rallies? Temperament more suited to the defensive style.         |\\n| * Or am I the patient player who loves playing a quality game and     |\\n| gets a lot of satisfaction in controlling the opponent? A temperament |\\n| more suited to the deceptive stroke player.                           |\\n| THERE ARE ALSO A SECOND SET OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU CAN ASK YOURSELF    |\\n| SUCH AS:                                                              |\\n| * Do I have the physical ability to play this type of badminton       |\\n| singles style?                                                        |\\n| * Does the strength to execute continuous sharp and very powerful     |\\n| smashes come easily to me?                                            |\\n| * Am I physically too short to play the aggressive type of game, like |\\n| giving me little time to cover the court well as compared to a tall   |\\n| player whose reflexes are just as fast as mine and their court        |\\n| coverage are better?                                                  |\\n| * I have lots of physical fitness and good mental toughness. How      |\\n| should I use them effectively?                                        |\\n| THE THIRD SET OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU CAN ASK YOURSELF:                 |\\n| * Do I have the ability to produce the shots to play this type of     |\\n| game?                                                                 |\\n| * Are my shots mostly straightforward, consistent and deep or are     |\\n| they deceptive?                                                       |\\n| * What are my most potent strokes?

Do not just follow or copy the trend or your  |\\n| idol's pattern of play. Only then can you develop your own style to   |\\n| the highest possible standard and challenge others.                   |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  \",\n",

       " [\"\\n\\nBadminton Training for All\\n\\nBeing good at any sport is not enough. RIGOROUS PRACTICE AND FOCUS are\\nthe two keys to excellence.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| To be good at this sport requires a combination of multiple assets    |\\n| like physical strength, flexibility, co-ordination, quick thinking.   |\\n| Here is all you need to know about badminton training to improve your |\\n| game and increase your stamina.                                       |\\n| A badminton training program is much more than just game practice. It |\\n| includes nutrition advice, rest, psychology, stretching exercises and |\\n| weight training. An ideal training program gives you desired results  |\\n| and is time- efficient too. Basic and long term training programs     |\\n| help build stamina and fitness over long durations through regular    |\\n| exercising and practice.                                              |\\n| Specialized badminton training programs however help players gain a   |\\n| winning edge over their opponents. A training session is an           |\\n| appropriate combination of work out sessions and conditioning work.   |\\n| 'Ghosting', which means players rally with an imaginary shuttle cock, |\\n| taking different stances and positions, is the commonly used method   |\\n| for the latter. However, the mode and pace of ghosting changes        |\\n| throughout the session. A badminton training session can be modified  |\\n| according to specific needs, TARGETING A PLAYER'S WEAK AND            |\\n| PROBLEMATIC AREA.                                                     |\\n| Other than this badminton training involves various exercise          |\\n| routines. Start with short spanned rigorous exercises like running,   |\\n| jumping or ghosting. Intense rallying would help to build up stamina  |\\n| and endurance.                                                        |\\n| To choose an individual badminton training program it's essential to  |\\n| assess your strengths and weaknesses- both mental and physical.       |\\n| Physical weaknesses are relatively easy to deal with.                 |\\n| Thirty minutes of cardio vascular exercises 30 minutes a day, three   |\\n| times a week would significantly improve your stamina. Cardio work    |\\n| outs should be ideally avoided right before a game though.            |\\n| Weight training and leg exercises like sprinting help increase        |\\n| explosive power on the court. Short sprints one day a week is ideal   |\\n| for badminton players. There are various kinds of sprints and         |\\n| exercises you can take up:                                            |\\n| 1. PARTNER BALL THROW - stand with your eyes closed and let the       |\\n| partner throw a soft, spongy ball towards you from the other side of  |\\n| the net. Open your eyes after you get a signal that the ball has been |\\n| thrown. Now try to catch the ball as soon as possible.                |\\n| 2. BALL RETRIEVAL - place a number of shuttlecocks along the net      |\\n| line. Run to the shuttles and retrieve them one by one to a chosen    |\\n| base, say the back edge of the court. Timing yourself is also an      |\\n| option.                                                               |\\n| 3. PLYOMETRIC EXERCISES - hopping and jumping, at a fast pace with    |\\n| small contact time between the feet and the ground. These exercises   |\\n| can be strenuous however and should be done in the presence of a      |\\n| coach/trainer and in optimum fitness levels only.                     |\\n| Strength training, twice a week will help you gain extra power to     |\\n| fuel your game. Various abdominal exercises using weights or Swiss    |\\n| balls can be adapted to different fitness levels. It will add that    |\\n| extra power to improve your serve and returns by toning your mid      |\\n| section area.                                                         |\\n| You can adjust your badminton training to your specific fitness level |\\n| and needs. Advice of a qualified coach is always recommended.         |\\n| Observing the game of a professional can help you improve your        |\\n| tactical ability and skills.                                          |\\n| A positive frame of mind is an indispensable asset of a winner. Avoid |\\n| pessimistic thoughts and tendencies to give up.

NERVOUSNESS begins to |\\n| take over all emotions and players begin to tell themselves that they |\\n| are going to lose a match which they have yet to begin.               |\\n| Everything seems to be all going wrong at this point of time. But     |\\n| this is a normal behavior. It is perfectly normal to feel this way    |\\n| when a player is about to begin his first match in a competition,     |\\n| especially if it's the first competition that he or she is            |\\n| participating.                                                        |\\n| BEING NERVOUS IN A GAME CAN COST A PLAYER TO LOSE IT. When a player   |\\n| feels nervous, he or she cannot be able to perform at his peak.       |\\n| Strokes cannot be delivered and unforced errors begin to happen. The  |\\n| heart beats faster than usual and players begin to feel tired very    |\\n| quickly compared to his normal training sessions.                     |\\n| All this are because of jittery nerves. Ever feel yourself in this    |\\n| position before? Well...there are a few things that you can do to     |\\n| reduce such nervousness in a badminton game.                          |\\n| 1. DO NOT GIVE UP and don't tell yourself that you are going to lose  |\\n| when the game has not even started.                                   |\\n| 2. Be confident in yourself. Do not let the opponent's reputation     |\\n| instill fear in you. If he/she is more popular in the badminton       |\\n| circle, this should inspire you more to win him as you have no        |\\n| pressure at all because you are the underdog.                         |\\n| 3. Prepare yourself mentally and think of what your strengths are the |\\n| night before the competition. This is to boost your own confidence    |\\n| and let you focus on the strengths that you have to beat and overcome |\\n| your opponent.                                                        |\\n| 4. Always concentrate on the game and not what others say. Do not let |\\n| others influence you by saying that it is impossible to win someone   |\\n| who is greater than you. NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS WORLD.         |\\n| 5. BE DETERMINED of what you want to achieve the moment you step into |\\n| the court. Be sure of the goals that you want and work towards it!    |\\n| 6. Do something that you can relax to before the game starts. Such as |\\n| listening to some music that can calm and soothe your nerves or       |\\n| laughing and joking around with your friends.                         |\\n| Sometimes being nervous inside a badminton court is not exactly bad.  |\\n| Not all bad things are bad as you can change negative influences to   |\\n| positive ones. It is the way you look at things.                      |\\n| Being nervous sometimes gives a person that extra adrenaline rush     |\\n| which can lead to their victory, but if a player is unable to manage  |\\n| those nerves and give in to it, half the battle will already be lost  |\\n| before it has even started.                                           |\\n| Being nervous before a game is something everyone has to go through   |\\n| in life when they play their first competition. Cold sweat and cold   |\\n| palms are alright.                                                    |\\n| It is impossible to eliminate nervousness each time we step into the  |\\n| court for a match. To improve is not how you eliminate nervousness,   |\\n| but it is how well you MANAGE IT and how you USE IT TO HELP YOURSELF. |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n \",\n",

       " [\"\\n\\nNutrition and Badminton\\n\\nNutrition is an important component of badminton because it is an energy\\nsapping, fast paced, quick reflexes oriented, fast racket game where the\\nSPEED OF THE SMASH IS MORE THAN 200MPH when the shuttle leaves the\\nracket after the smash.\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| So a badminton player has to take care of his NUTRITIONAL             |\\n| REQUIREMENTS on and off his badminton days to maintain a balance. For |\\n| example, on an off day, you may require 2500 to 3000 calories whereas |\\n| on competition day, you may require up to 5000 calories. Similarly,   |\\n| your requirement for water, carbohydrates, electrolytes and other     |\\n| nutrients vary between his off day and competition day.               |\\n| On a day-to-day basis, you have to take care of your nutrition by     |\\n| consuming A WELL BALANCED DIET comprising carbohydrate, fat, protein, |\\n| electrolytes, vitamins, minerals and water. A nutritionist can extend |\\n| help in achieving this.                                               |\\n| In the days preceding a competition, it is better for you to eat LESS |\\n| CARBOHYDRATE AND MORE FAT AND PROTEIN. It depletes his glycogen       |\\n| stores in the liver. Then, for a day or two preceding the competition |\\n| you can go for increased carbohydrate, which replenishes glycogen     |\\n| storage to an optimal level.                                          |\\n| It enables you to endure the event better by providing you the        |\\n| necessary glucose during play by the breakdown of glycogen. Also it   |\\n| is better to drink beverages containing glucose during rest between   |\\n| plays and avoid fructose-containing beverages.                        |\\n| It is because fructose has to be converted into glucose for the body  |\\n| to use it, which takes time, predisposing the individual to low blood |\\n| sugars and fatigue. FRUCTOSE CAN ALSO UPSET YOUR STOMACH.             |\\n| Contrary to popular belief, badminton players require VERY LITTLE     |\\n| ADDITIONAL PROTEIN than the general population to maintain their      |\\n| health. Usually, they can get the increments by diet alone. No        |\\n| protein nutritional supplements are needed.                           |\\n| Overenthusiastic protein intake predisposes to constant thirst,       |\\n| dehydration, decreased desire to consume food, loose motions and      |\\n| added stress on kidneys besides adding to the cost of training.       |\\n| Among electrolytes, sodium needs can be met just by increasing their  |\\n| amounts in the diet during competition days. Consuming salt tablets   |\\n| indiscriminately can cause vomiting sensation, vomiting and bloating  |\\n| of stomach due to retention of water by the salt thereby affecting    |\\n| the player's performance. Similarly, additional potassium             |\\n| requirements can also be met with diet alone by INCLUDING POTASSIUM   |\\n| RICH FOOD LIKE BANANAS regularly.                                     |\\n| VITAMINS AND MINERALS ARE TO BE OBTAINED BY DIET OPTIMALLY. Badminton |\\n| players require vitamins like thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and       |\\n| minerals like iron to utilize the additional calories they need       |\\n| during playing. These vitamins and minerals are to be obtained by     |\\n| including fresh fruits, vegetables, greens, eggs etc. in their diet.  |\\n| Water should be CONSUMED IN JUST ADEQUATE AMOUNTS before, during and  |\\n| after play, ideally at the amounts required to quench the player's    |\\n| thirst. Drinking too much water in the presumption that it can        |\\n| diminish thirst and improve fitness is wrong as it can lead to water  |\\n| intoxication. Similarly, drinking too less water thinking that it may |\\n| slow the game by bloating the stomach is also a misplaced concept.    |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  \",\n",

Though, as far as quality is          |\\n| concerned, you may not be able to find a really funny joke, cartoon   |\\n| or picture so easily. But still there are a lot of badminton funny    |\\n| cartoons and pictures available on the Internet.                      |\\n| Those who have a little knowledge know that cartoons about the sport  |\\n| of badminton have a long history associated with them. One of the     |\\n| most famous and recorded badminton funny cartoons was published by    |\\n| PUNCH MAGAZINE IN THE YEAR 1854.                                      |\\n| Let\\'s come back to badminton jokes. One of the most simple and short  |\\n| badminton jokes could be \"BAD MINTON\". Badminton is unquestionably a  |\\n| very popular sport around the world. Perhaps there is something       |\\n| really funny in the name itself, e.g. there are many terms and        |\\n| accessories associated with the sport that make this sport a funny    |\\n| one, such as \"shuttlecock\", \"shuttle\", \"cock\", \"love all\", \"service   |\\n| over\" and \"change ends\" etc.                                          |\\n| Jokes are jokes; they can come in any form or type, so it all depends |\\n| upon who says and what, and in what circumstances. For example, it is |\\n| said that in order to score in badminton a player must place his cock |\\n| in his opponent\\'s court with thrust. It is really funny when it is    |\\n| generally said that in badminton a player may only handle the cock    |\\n| before serving or after scoring.                                      |\\n| I still remember, when a childhood friend of mine once said, \"If a    |\\n| player does not get the cock into his opponents court for any reason  |\\n| then he does not score and cannot try again until he has service      |\\n| again.\"                                                               |\\n| I am sure, everybody who in some form or other is related to          |\\n| badminton sport, knows that in badminton damaged cocks aren\\'t used as |\\n| this can cause irritation to the court surface. No doubt, courts are  |\\n| delicate so should be handled with utmost care and delicacy.          |\\n| Therefore it is sometimes said that rubber covers (of course in       |\\n| badminton) are highly advised for safety as they are about 99% less   |\\n| likely to damage the court.                                           |\\n| Wise people say beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. So true,     |\\n| especially when it comes to jokes. There are many people who may not  |\\n| laugh even at decent jokes, whereas there are people who would start  |\\n| bursting at some simple lines.

Start them with few basic rules.                                   |\\n| 2. Once they become proficient with them, keep on adding the other    |\\n| rules.                                                                |\\n| 3. Encourage them during their play.                                  |\\n| 4. Once the play is over, demonstrate the correct stance and shots    |\\n| instead of concentrating on the mistakes they made.                   |\\n| 5. Teach about the practice modalities to improve their performance   |\\n| in the subsequent days.                                               |\\n| 6. Teach them the skills they need to master for the following games. |\\n| 7. Emphasize on first aid requirement and basic first aid measures.   |\\n| The following badminton teaching tips are to be concentrated on when  |\\n| coaching a beginner or an intermediate level player:                  |\\n| 1. How to appropriately serve without missing.                        |\\n| 2. The biomechanics of the execution of various shots.                |\\n| 3. The art of covering the court to reach the shuttle better.         |\\n| 4. The choice of shot to win over an opponent.                        |\\n| 5. The mistakes to be avoided, for example, the shuttle should always |\\n| be directed to land on vacant areas in the opponent's court to always |\\n| keep him on the move. It must be kept in mind that any opponent can   |\\n| execute deadly accurate shots when he is not on the move and the      |\\n| shuttle is hit for his easy reach.                                    |\\n| In addition, badminton teaching tips should focus on the following    |\\n| regarding doubles and mixed doubles players:                          |\\n| 1. How to cover the court without clashing.                           |\\n| 2. How to make appropriate service returns.                           |\\n| 3. To what extent, each have to stretch and take the shot without     |\\n| getting confused.                                                     |\\n| 4. How to assess the opponent's weakness and be able to exploit it to |\\n| the maximum. It is especially important to assess the opponent girl's |\\n| weakness in mixed doubles and use it to advantage.                    |\\n| 5. How to channelise your attack.                                     |\\n| 6. How to indulge in cross court defense and attack.                  |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\n  \",\n",

       " ['\\n\\nMotivation in Badminton\\n\\nTry to answer the following questions first. How did George Washington\\ndefeat the English to liberate US? How did Magellan voyage around the\\nworld when navigation systems were primitive? How did Alexander and\\nChengiz Khan conquer much of the world in their time?\\n\\n  --\\n  --\\n\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n| Well, the answer lies in a single magic word. MOTIVATION. May be this |\\n| is the single most important word which has made us what we are       |\\n| today. The same applies to badminton as well. If you have the         |\\n| motivation to play badminton well, you will.                          |\\n| You know, it is no longer true that champions are born, not bred. It  |\\n| has been conclusively proved that it is the motivation to excel in    |\\n| big stage, which separates champions from others. It is similar to    |\\n| the hare and tortoise story where the motivation to do consistently   |\\n| well was the single factor, which the tortoise followed to defeat the |\\n| hare.                                                                 |\\n| But for motivation to come, ONE MUST HEARTILY LIKE BADMINTON. You     |\\n| cannot get motivation to do something unless you like it. Your        |\\n| motivation will naturally tell you that badminton is an easy game and |\\n| that you can play it well.                                            |\\n| But is it enough? Surely no. Because next you need motivation to      |\\n| focus on your game to play good badminton. You must focus on your     |\\n| strengths as well as weaknesses. It means you have to fine tune your  |\\n| strengths and minimize your weaknesses by constantly practicing them  |\\n| well. For example, if you are weak in smashing, you concentrate       |\\n| smashing well in your practice, believing that you can smash well.    |\\n| When in CONSTANT PRACTICE, the various body parts perfectly           |\\n| synchronize themselves without you realizing it when we play          |\\n| different badminton strokes. In this process, our reaction time is    |\\n| saved by microseconds in a crunch game, which is sufficient to        |\\n| overrun the opponent in a fast game like badminton.                   |\\n| For you to focus, you must have the motivation to avoid the           |\\n| distractions that come with badminton. For example, where will you    |\\n| focus when you are playing in front of hundreds of noisy spectators   |\\n| supporting your opponent and crying for your blood?                   |\\n| Well, you focus on the SHUTTLECOCK AND SHUT OUT EVERYTHING ELSE. You  |\\n| will realize the importance of avoiding distractions if you           |\\n| understand that while the hare got distracted by everything in its    |\\n| path, the tortoise just focused with motivation on the finish line    |\\n| and came first.                                                       |\\n| You must also have motivation to develop a positive attitude to play  |\\n| good badminton. It has been observed that the motivation, not the     |\\n| ability, to play the toughest and unimaginable shots taking the rival |\\n| by surprise is what separates badminton champions from average        |\\n| players. The champions even surprise themselves when doing so.        |\\n| Obviously, having a positive attitude alone is not sufficient if you  |\\n| have the fear of getting defeated. Failure fear is one thing, which   |\\n| prevented legendary tennis player Ivan Lendl from winning Wimbledon   |\\n| throughout his career.                                                |\\n| For you to develop motivation to eliminate fear of failure, it is     |\\n| essential for you to understand that playing badminton is not a war   |\\n| and failing in a game is not a crime. You are not going to be         |\\n| prosecuted or shot at. YOU CAN ALWAYS GET UP THE NEXT MORNING TO PLAY |\\n| BETTER BADMINTON.                                                     |\\n| Finally, motivation to read the opponent and anticipating in advance  |\\n| as to what shot he is going to play at you is the clinching factor in |\\n| making you a true badminton champion. IT GIVES YOU A FEW MILLISECONDS |\\n| EXTRA IN EXECUTING YOUR STROKE BETTER.                                |\\n| It is a proven fact that an expert professional badminton player      |\\n| decides faster on what side his opponent is going to smash than an    |\\n| average amateur player, enabling him to earn a few milliseconds to    |\\n| tune his response better to the shot.                                 |\\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n',\n",

Yet there were hints of dark clouds on the horizon to be discerned in the shifting politics behind the official press release.\\n\\nBeyond the restoration of Zimbabwe and Nepal\\'s membership, the notable news emerging from the meeting was ICC\\'s stated ambition to increase the number of flagship global events to one per year for both the men\\'s and women\\'s games, looking to put on eight men\\'s events and eight women\\'s events over the course of an eight-year cycle, as well as four U19 events for each. Equally notable was the suggestion that allocation of hosting rights would move toward a more open bidding model, hinting that the monopoly that England, Australia and India currently hold may not be permanent.\\n\\nOther decisions included abolition of the boundary count-back rule in case of a tied Super Over at ICC events, an increase in prize money money for flagship women\\'s tournaments, and the reappointment of Indra Nooyi as independent director for another two-year term. Of rather more direct relevance for Associates was the approval of the $30.5 million revenue distribution to Associate Members for 2020, ticking up by 12% on 2019 as the new competition structure goes into full swing. Malaysia and Uganda were confirmed as hosts for the second rounds of Challenge Leagues A and B respectively, the former scheduled to be in the third week of March at Kuala Lumpur, and the latter starting in late July at Kampala.\\n\\nNepal and Zimbabwe coming in from the cold, the latter after a suspension of three months, the former provisionally reinstated after over three years in limbo, was widely expected on both counts. Naturally, the announcement has been broadly welcomed in both countries, though in Zimbabwe as sense of relief is matched by a degree of pessimistic resignation.\\n\\nThe lifting of the suspension comes too late for Zimbabwe to contest the T20 World Cup Qualifiers which begin this week in the UAE. Nigeria having been invited to take their place as the third African nation. Worse still, many see both Zimbabwe\\'s suspension and reinstatement as undercutting any prospect of arresting the country\\'s long-term cricketing decline, entrenching a board widely perceived as at best incompetent and at worst corrupt.\\n\\nThe suspension was initially precipitated by the intervention of the Zimbabwean Sports and Recreation Commission, who suspended the ZC board in June on grounds that office bearers acted as \"a law unto themselves\". The ICC sided decisively with ZC Chairman Tavengwa Mukuhlani in dubbing this \"political interference,\" and the SRC was duly forced to back down. The subsequent reinstatement will only strengthen the board\\'s hand going forward, even as the country\\'s readmission to ICC competition will doubtless come as a relief to many.\\n\\nFor Nepal, their conditional restoration of membership in good standing came with a few caveats, most notably continued controls on funding, but was also followed up a day later by a bittersweet addendum as Paras Khadka, Nepal\\'s iconic captain and stand-out all-rounder for the past decade, announced he would step down from the captaincy. Nepal will likewise be missing the T20 World Cup Qualifier next week, having stumbled to a third-place finish at the Asia regional finals behind Singapore and Qatar. Even as the confirmation of a new board and subsequent readmission will provide a degree of administrative stability, Khadka\\'s leadership both on and off the field will doubtless be sorely missed.\\n\\nEven so, the announcement of Nepal\\'s readmission can only be seen as good news for the cricket-mad country, and the game itself. The proposals regarding the ICC\\'s events calendar, however, may prove less positive than they at first appear. It emerged after the meeting that the additional events currently on the table comprise a Champions Trophy-style 50-over competition with restricted participation, featuring as few as six teams, and a similarly exclusionary T20I tournament to be held once every four years, rather than the T20 World Cup returning to a two-year cycle.\\n\\nThe filling of the calendar with such additional mini-tournaments also suggests that any Olympic ambitions have been shelved indefinitely, with any reference to the potentially transformative inclusion of cricket in the Olympics conspicuously absent. Nor was there any indication that either of the existing competitions would become more inclusive, raising the prospect of an event-packed calendar for Full Members featuring two exclusive \"mini tournaments\", a ten-team 50-over World Cup and a nominally 16-team T20 World Cup which is in effect still restricted to 12 teams in the main phase. In short, the proposals as envisaged could potentially see Associates entirely excluded from the global stage.\\n\\nThe very notion of a return to one ICC event per year was also met with opposition from the BCCI, whose reaction to developments in Dubai will likely have caused plenty of concern in Associate boardrooms. BCCI CEO Rahul Johri is understood to have opposed the proposals put forward at the Chief Executives Committee meeting, concerned at additional ICC events crowding out bilateral cricket or eating into the space left in the calendar for franchise T20 leagues, with revenues from the former accruing to the ICC whilst the latter two are a key source of revenue for member boards. With BCCI elections taking place at the time, India held off on committing to the new calendar.\\n\\nStill more concerningly, newly-elected BCCI president Sourav Ganguly immediately adopted a combative stance in his first public statement, again raising the question of the apportionment of the ICC\\'s surplus revenue distributions between member boards. Claiming that the BCCI \"we have not received any money for the last three or four years from the ICC,\" Ganguly repeated the argument that \"we generate 75-80 percent in revenues\" referring to the estimated figure that was circulated around the time of the 2014 \"Big 3\" reforms, that the lion\\'s share of revenue raised by ICC events derives from the Indian market. This same argument was the justification for the five-fold increase in the BCCI\\'s share of the ICC\\'s revenue distribution set out in the the 2014 reforms.\\n\\nThat increase has since been pared back somewhat at subsequent ICC meetings, while the BCCI has been hamstrung by internal administrative wrangling. The one constant at each revision of the distribution model, however, is that the overall proportion funding allocated to Associates and to development in general has been repeatedly cut back as Full Members looked to secure their own slice of the pie. The BCCI now seems intent on restoring something close to the 500% increase they initially secured in 2014, potentially setting up a new conflict with other Full Member boards on both funding and scheduling. Conversely, the final line of the ICC\\'s official press noted the establishment of a Governance Working Group \"to consider future governance structure of the ICC,\" - a group conspicuously lacking any representatives from either the BCCI or the ECB.\\n\\nWith the ICC apparently pressing for the inclusion of two new events on the calendar, neither of which are likely to feature more than a handful of members, and the BCCI gearing up for yet another clash over revenue distribution which threatens to squeeze what remains of the Associates\\' share still further, it seems inevitable that regardless of who prevails in the apparently impending spat between the game\\'s governing body and its one financially indispensable member, the Associates will again lose out.\\n\\nWhen elephants fight, as they say, it\\'s the grass that suffers.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nIndia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n15h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

Mustafizur missed the first-phase game of the NCL, Bangladesh\\' premier first-class event, on account of his non-recovery from the ankle injury.\\n\\nBCB earlier stated that the national cricketers will have to take part in at least two editions of NCL as part of their preparation for the upcoming tour of India, scheduled in November, comprising three T20Is followed by two Test matches.\\n\\nThe team management has decided to utilise Mustafizur sparingly by judiciously managing his Test workload in the recent past. However, according to the chief selector, his availability for selection for the tour of India will be judged by his ability to withstand pressure in the longer format of the NCL.\\n\\nMustafizur is expected to feature in the second phase of NCL, scheduled to begin on October 17, when he takes the field for Khulna Division against Rajshahi Division at their hometown.\\n\\n\"He (Mustafizur) will have to prove his fitness in the NCL game to be considered for the upcoming Test series against India,\" Abedin told reporters at the BCB premises on Tuesday (October 15).\\n\\n\"The physio had given us some guidelines. He was supposed to play from the very first match. However, because he has some minor problem with his ankle, he was not able to take the full load and therefore, was unable to play the first match (of the NCL)\" he said.\\n\\n\"He is in the recovery phase now. We have to assess how many overs he can bowl. I have been given a guideline that he cannot bowl more than 15 overs (per day) in the upcoming match and so we will consider that and subsequently assess his fitness during the four-day games\" he said.\\n\\nHe further added that Mustafizur\\'s selection for the Tests in India would purely be the team management\\'s call: \"This is completely the decision of team management.\" he said. \"We don\\'t work in the field. There is fitness trainer, bowling coach, who will judge whether he can bowl in back-to-back matches and how many overs he can bowl.\"\\n\\nAbedin also expressed concerns over the fitness of the national team\\'s pacers, given that the likes of Taskin Ahmed and Mohammad Saifuddin are recovering from injuries.\\n\\n\"We were really concerned about our pace bowlers, because right now, there are many players who are unavailable due to injury. If I make a list of ten players, then five of them will be on the injury list,\" said Abedin.\\n\\n\"Our pace bowlers are always criticized for their fitness levels. Now, however, the way we are prioritizing our fitness from the first-class level, I think we will get the results in two years. If you don\\'t have good fitness, it is really tough to bowl in two innings,\" said Abedin, implicitly referring to the beep-test that has been made mandatory for the NCL.\\n\\n\"We have to do well in every department to win - pace bowling, spin bowling, slow pace (variations) - every section. How you are executing your ability is important. You do not need to bowl at 140 (km/h). You can dismiss a batsman at 120 with some good swing. If a fast bowler can bowl 80-85 percent of ball in the right areas, then he can definitely put the batsman under pressure.\"\\n\\nAbedin added that some of the Test members will take confidence from the recently-concluded series against Sri Lanka A, given they played in challenging conditions.\\n\\n\"We haven\\'t been getting results that are up to the mark on away tours. The players who have gone there (Sri Lanka), played really well. This experience abroad, I hope, will help in India, because we haven\\'t been able to replicate our home performances abroad,\" he said.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nMustafizur Rahman\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

There is bickering all the time, so you will see equations change. But if someone from outside needles us, we will unite and fight against them.\"\\n\\nSo it came as no surprise that when the old guards of BCCI had to wrestle back power, they knew their best bet would be to have a united front. And to compose that unity, N Srinivasan was the frontman, later supported by Anurag Thakur. They convinced almost all the state associations on this plan. One of the key members who didn\\'t buy straightaway into this idea was UPCA\\'s Rajiv Shukla. However, his reluctance too was nipped in the bud and it didn\\'t take long for him to realise that he had invited trouble by going against the masterplan.\\n\\nTill afternoon, a day ahead of the deadline for filing the nominations for elections, certain things were clear. They needed a cricketer to be the face of newly the reformed body, and in that Sourav Ganguly and Brijesh Patel were shortlisted. While Ganguly was certainly a bigger name as a cricketer, Brijesh brought along years of experience as an administrator, reputation and was a highly trusted member of the Srinivasan clan.\\n\\nWhat was also sure until then was that Jay Shah and Arun Dhumal will contest for the posts of secretary and treasurer respectively. With two of Thakur\\'s men already taking key positions in the BCCI apex council, it was almost a straightforward pathway for Brijesh to get the president\\'s post.\\n\\nIt was all very well set up. Srinvasan had reportedly met Home Minister Amit Shah in the morning, and by the time Anurag Thakur joined the discussion, everything seemed equally distributed, with each party getting an equal share, and so also each of the zones.\\n\\nBut then began the lobbying. It took hours of deliberation even on Sunday. For a meeting that had started early in the morning, it was only close to 11:00 PM that the flip eventually happened.\\n\\nFor Srinivasan\\'s candidate to be ousted, there needed to be more powerful forces at play. And given the nature of the job and its profile, it was attracting the attention from all across the country. Ganguly, soon after filing his nomination, might have discredited the role of a \\'big politician\\' involved in the process. But those in the know-how of the developments admit the gamechanger was the role of a politician from Assam, a man who holds considerable influence for the national ruling party in the North-East. His backing of Ganguly is believed to have tipped the scales firmly in favour of the former India captain.\\n\\nWhat power-battles and bargaining took place in private - to fight on behalf of Ganguly and convince Srinivasan - in the midst of all this remains only a matter of speculation at the moment.\\n\\nThat Ganguly was eventually chosen as the nominee for president allowed Srinivasan to field Kerala Cricket Association\\'s Jayesh George for the post of joint secretary. However, he remained Srinivasan\\'s only trusted man in the setup, with Thakur eventually having three of his.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nSourav Ganguly\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

The Board meeting was attended by ICC Chairman Shashank Manohar, Zimbabwe Cricket Chairman Tavengwa Mukuhlani, Zimbabwe Sports Minister Kirsty Coventry and Gerald Mlotshwa, the Chairman of the Sports and Recreation Commission.\\n\\nICC Chairman Shashank Manohar noted: \"I would like to thank the Zimbabwe Sports Minister for her commitment to the reinstatement of Zimbabwe Cricket. Her desire to work in support of Zimbabwe Cricket was clear and she has unconditionally complied with the conditions set down by the ICC Board. Funding to Zimbabwe Cricket will continue to be on a controlled basis as part of a collective effort behind getting the game in Zimbabwe back on an even keel.\"\\n\\n\"We are elated to get our membership restored and this marks the beginning of a new, exciting chapter for our cricket, with ZC\\'s focus now fully back on ensuring our game is thriving, sustainable and financially stable,\" Mukuhlani, the ZC Chairman, said.\\n\\n\"This would not have been possible without the steadfast support of the ICC and our colleagues from other member boards and we are very grateful to them,\" he added.\\n\\nThe African nation was suspended in July this year as the board violated provisions of Article 2.4 (c) and (d) of the ICC Constitution \"which imposes an obligation on Members to provide a process for free and democratic elections and to ensure that there is no government interference in its governance and / or administration for cricket respectively\". The governing body had also stated that all ICC funding to ZC would be frozen and representative teams from Zimbabwe won\\'t be able to participate in any ICC events.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Nepal were also readmitted on a conditional basis. In October this year, the Central Working Committee\\'s election was conducted with an Independent Panel supervising it under the ambit of the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) constitution, which in turn ensured Nepal\\'s readmission.\\n\\nThe Asian nation was suspended in 2016 for violating the ICC regulations, which \"prohibit government interference and require fair elections\". Since Nepal\\'s suspension, ICC has been working closely with Nepal Advisory Group (NAG) which comprises representatives of CAN, the Nepal Government and the broader cricket community to draft a new constitution - one of the major conditions that was set by the ICC to CAN in May 2016 for reinstatement.\\n\\n\"Given the progress made in Nepal, a transition plan will now be developed for the Cricket Association of Nepal to support full compliance with Associate Membership criteria, which will also involve controlled funding,\" Manohar said.\\n\\nThe ICC Board also confirmed a $30.5 million funding to be allocated for Associate Members for 2020 - a 12% increase on 2019. The amount would be handed out as per the \"Associate Member scorecard competition and grant model\". It will support all forms of the development of the game in 92 nations.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nZimbabwe Nepal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

Today, it was Ahmed Shehzad's turn, and importantly, it came in a winning effort unlike Azam's.\\n\\nAfter a 448-run slug-fest in Faisalabad, Shehzad's unbeaten century had trumped Asif Ali's hurricane 93 as Northern were beaten with one ball to spare.\\n\\nAli was absolutely sensational early on, skyrocketing an innings that was faltering at 59/3 when he came in around the ninth over mark. From there, he spearheaded a brutal onslaught with Mohammad Nawaz playing second-fiddle in their 107-run partnership. Imad Wasim then scored 22 off the last five balls of the innings as Northern posted 222 to complete a remarkable turnaround.\\n\\nBut, as it happened, their lacklustre first-half with the bat came back to bite them. Even after losing Azam and Kamran Akmal early, Shehzad ensured that Central Punjab stayed the course. He found brief, but handy contributors right through the middle-order, which was all that he needed as he scored about half the team's runs himself, while also staying there till the end to get the job done.\\n\\nBrief Scores: Northern 222-6 in 20 overs (Asif Ali 93, Mohammad Nawaz 51, Umar Amin 38, Imad Wasim 22; Faheem Ashraf 3-44) lost to Central Punjab 226-6 in 19.5 overs (Ahmed Shehzad 111, Saad Nasim 29, Faheem Ashraf 28, Rizwan Hussain 20; Imad Wasim 3-38, Sohail Tanvir 2-50) by 4 wickets.\\n\\nSouthern Punjab vs Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\\n\\nWahab Riaz took three wickets and also composed an unbeaten 17-ball 42 to help Southern Punjab secure a four-wicket win versus Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at Faisalabad's Iqbal Stadium. Southern Punjab hunted down the target of 155 for the loss of six wickets and with nine balls to spare.\\n\\nRiaz ran through the batting order to leave Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in trouble at 51 for 4. At that stage, Mohammad Rizwan and Khushdil Shah joined forces to share a stand of 83 and pilot the side to a score of some respectability.\\n\\nIn pursuit of a rather modest target, Southern Punjab too lost wickets at regular intervals and found themselves in a precarious position at 51 for 5. However, Saif Badar cracked a 35-ball 49 not out, while Riaz clubbed five fours and two sixes to guide Southern Punjab home.\\n\\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa154/5 in 20 overs (Khushdil Shah 56*, Mohammad Rizwan 45; Wahab Riaz 3-28) lost to Southern Punjab 155/6 in 18.3 overs (Saif Badar 49*, Wahab Riaz 42*; Mohammad Mohsin 3-37) by 4 wickets.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nPakistan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

Vidarbha skipper Faiz Fazal lucked out with the toss and opted to bowl first on a wicket that has largely supported the leather-wielders over the course of this tournament.\\n\\nThere were no real partnerships of note, with Rajneesh Gurbani accounting for the openers, and the spin trio of Karnewar, Wakhare and Sarwate running through the rest of the line-up over the course by the 40th over. The final wicket showed some resistance, playing out 50 overs, with No. 10 batsman Rishi Arothe top-scoring with 30, in a 37-run stand with Babashafi Pathan (also the highest stand) to lift the score to 131. Akshay Wakhare was the pick of the bowlers with four middle-order wickets.\\n\\nThe chase was as smooth-sailing as Vidarbha would have imagined it. Fazal and Jitesh Sharma stitched together a 71-run stand for the opening wicket. Sharma's wicket triggered a triune of wickets, but Akshay Wadkar steadied the ship along with Faiz Fazal (who scored a stable half-century) to see Vidarbha through to the target with more than 15 overs to spare - a much-needed morale boost after the thumping at the hands of Uttar Pradesh on Monday (October 14).\\n\\nBrief Scores:Baroda 131 all-out in 50 overs (Rishi Arothe 30; Akshay Wakhare 4-22) lost to Vidarbha 134-3 (Faiz Fazal 58*, Jitesh Sharma 37; Yusuf Pathan 1-13) by 7 wickets.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

I was there and though I stayed for 3-4 days, I got fed up (about it). We have to think about that and discuss with the players and support staff. We are playing the Test Championship and we want to do well in that too,\" Silva was quoted as saying by Island Cricket.\\n\\nWhile stating that staying put in the hotel had its upsides in terms of team bonding and security of players, he added that the downsides far outweighed it.\\n\\n\"Frankly in my opinion, it was good team bonding when they are staying in the hotel without their wives. Too much of freedom is also bad for the players. But, they have to go out to do shopping, they have to eat somewhere, all those things are there. They have to go out and see the world. They can\\'t stay inside the hotel.\"\\n\\nSri Lanka finished the tour with a clean sweep of the T20I series after having lost the ODIs 2-0. While stating that process of travelling to the venue for the limited overs series was exhausting, he added that it might be tough for the teams to return and go through the same process for multi-day games.\\n\\n\"We have to reassess and see about Test matches. We owed something to Pakistan because they are there for us, because they always helped us. We were willing to bear that up (security hassle), but the problem is how much we could bear?\\n\\n\"I heard security there is getting better.

The decision was taken during the ICC board meetings in Dubai which concluded on Monday (October 14), with the cricket governing body also announcing that the eight-year cricketing cycle starting from 2023 will include one major men\\'s and women\\'s ICC event every year along with four events apiece for Under-19 men and women cricketers.\\n\\n\"In examining a whole range of options, the Board felt a major Men\\'s and Women\\'s event each year will bring consistency to our calendar whilst complementing bilateral cricket, giving our sport a strong future foundation,\" ICC chairman Shashank Manohar said. \"It will provide clear structure and context to enable the growth of the sport and greater engagement opportunities for all of our stakeholders. The move towards a bidding model will give equal opportunities to all Members to host ICC events post 2023.\"\\n\\nThe first edition of the Under-19 Women\\'s World Cup will be played in Bangladesh in 2021 while the ICC also announced that the bidding process for the women\\'s and Under-19 events for the eight year cycle starting from 2023 will begin in early 2020.\\n\\nIn what comes as a further boost to women\\'s cricket, the ICC announced an increase of USD 2.6 million in prize money for women\\'s events. As per the ICC, the prize pot for Women\\'s World T20 in 2020 - USD 1 million for the winners and USD 500,000 for the runners-up - is a 320 percent increase from the amount that was on offer for 2018 while the prize money for the 50-over World Cup in 2021 will be USD 3.5 million, an increase of 1.5 million compared to 2017.\\n\\n\"We have already stated our long-term commitment to reach parity across men\\'s and women\\'s cricket as part of a broader plan to grow and develop the women\\'s game. We want to build a long-term sustainable foundation for women\\'s cricket and that is about more than just prize money. It is about building a product that fans want to watch, that kids want to take up, that sponsors and broadcasters want to be part of. Creating a Women\\'s U19 event also improves the pathway available to young cricketers and ensures they have the same opportunities as their male counterparts,\" ICC Chief Executive Manu Sawhney said.\\n\\n\"This is a journey we started in earnest in 2017 and next year it\\'s our ambition to fill the MCG on International Women\\'s Day for the final of the ICC Women\\'s T20 World Cup 2020 which would be a world record for a women\\'s sporting event. This significant increase in prize money and the introduction of a Women\\'s U19 event is part of a much larger effort to grow the women\\'s game around the world,\" he added.\\n\\nICC governance structure re-look\\n\\nA governance working group has been approved by the ICC which will \"consider future governance structure of the ICC\". Chaired by Cricket Australia\\'s Earl Eddings, the working group includes Greg Barclay (New Zealand Cricket), Tony Brian (Cricket Scotland), Ehsan Mani (Pakistan Cricket Board), Chris Nenzani (Cricket South Africa) and Ricky Skerritt (Cricket West Indies).\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

And now, on review by the ICC Cricket Committee, it has been scrapped altogether.\\n\\nApart from that, there\\'s another change, whereby the Super Over will now be employed even in Group Stages of ICC tournaments to pick a winner. But, unlike the knockouts, it won\\'t be repeated after a tie. Rather, points will be split between the teams.\\n\\n\"Following on from a recommendation from the ICC Cricket Committee, the Chief Executives\\' Committee agreed that the use of the Super Over as a way to decide results at ICC events will be retained. Both the Cricket Committee and CEC agreed it was an exciting and engaging conclusion to the game and will remain in place covering all games at both ODI and T20I World Cups,\" the release further added.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

The old guard was back. And it looked like they wanted all present to know that they were. Maybe it was them posturing, quite literally, upon their return to their erstwhile bastion of power. But they weren\\'t there by themselves though. Instead, after fighting to regain their lost power from the flanks for over three years, Srinivasan & Co were now flanking Sourav Ganguly, the soon-to-be new man in power.\\n\\nFor all of Ganguly\\'s reputation and accolades as a cricketer, he finds himself in a position of power due to a larger design, which involved the veteran administrators going hand in glove with the political powers to oust the Committee of Administrators, especially Vinod Rai, who had over and again stood his ground and didn\\'t do them much favours through the course of his tenure. It\\'s not like he and those under him, didn\\'t make mistakes. Even on the day of filing the nominations, the electoral officer was absent and the man appointed to collect the nomination on his behalf didn\\'t have an authority letter. The mistakes of his and his colleagues were under the lens of the unofficial legal team of the ousted administrators. And the rivals within the BCCI and outside used them to good effect.\\n\\nRai\\'s job was never going to be easy and against the clout of powerful men across the cricket and political spectrum of the country, the difficulty only amplified. He refused to cave in despite constant efforts to hold him down.\\n\\nBut he wasn\\'t the only one doing so. At the other end was Srinivasan, who was leading the battle on behalf of the state associations across the country, or as they like to call it - \\'the lovers of cricket who did yeoman service to the game\\'. The start of the entire saga was the spot-fixing and betting scandal that broke out during IPL 2013, with a little throwback to the Lalit Modi-Srinivasan rivalry. Srinivasan\\'s \\'cricket enthusiast\\' defense of his son-in-law and the refusal to resign from his position as the president of BCCI then eventually invited trouble and bad press for him. The Supreme Court got involved, his rivals joined in and an entire structure was designed to not just throw him and his ilk out but also to render their powers ineffective in the cricket system.\\n\\nBut Srinivasan was not to give in so easily. He too, much like Rai, took on powerful forces, and was at the forefront of uniting the cricket bodies in most parts of the country. In the end, it was all about who would blink first. Neither Srinivasan nor Rai did. Yet, the walk back to the BCCI office was a sign that Srinivasan had won the three-year long messy power struggle, which at so many points had just become an ego fight, with both factions crusading with the same PR note - \\'for the love of the game\\'. But this wasn\\'t quite the triumphant return that Srinivasan would have imagined. For it comes with a very strong caveat.\\n\\nHe\\'s after all not only had to join in consensus for Ganguly to become the president after lobbying heavily in favour of Brijesh Patel, but he\\'s also failed to get any of his trusted men in the three most important positions of the board - president, secretary and treasurer: all of which had been eventually influenced by BJP. Thus, the possibility that he would try to create another faction overnight wasn\\'t completely ruled out either, even by those close to the development. It has happened earlier, and with Srinivasan\\'s famed adamance and the need to be in power, it wouldn\\'t have been a surprise.\\n\\nExplaining Srinivasan\\'s love to be in a position of power, one of the long time administrators of BCCI had said soon after Justice Lodha made his recommendations: \"Srinivasan is my friend but I had also urged him to step down (after the betting scandal). But the problem is, he is adamant. He wouldn\\'t listen. He always felt that if he stepped down, he would lose power and will not be able to get that back again.\"\\n\\nBut in 2019, Srinivasan has put on a new avatar - probably willing to be a little less powerful, but still in control. One of the sources in the know says, \"It might seem from the outside that he has lost a bit of power. But even he knows it won\\'t make sense to take on BJP right now. And the main aim anyway was to throw CoA out. So, he has taken a step back and found the most effective way around this. He has chosen a better bargain. This is not the Srinivasan of old who won\\'t budge from what he wants.\"\\n\\nWhat he gets out of this bargain remains to be seen. As of the current rules, he is not eligible to be BCCI\\'s representative to the ICC. But the preparations to field him for that is believed to have started.\\n\\n. ©Cricbuzz\\n\\nHe\\'s not the only one who is set to gain from the rule changes, if it happens. Though Ganguly and Jay Shah are set to hold their respective offices only for a few months as things stand now, there\\'s a possibility that could change. Thus, while the world outside might be sympathising over the \\'10-month tenure\\', people within are quite at ease.\\n\\nIn whatever manner the political dynamics have worked, for Ganguly, the turn of events has put him in a position of power. He likes responsibility, and as a captain or even in his short tenure as an administrator with CAB, he has been proactive in bringing changes. He earns trust well, understands the requirements of the game, and like on Monday, talks cricket first. It\\'s the image the new faction wanted to portray for the \\'reformed BCCI\\', and Ganguly has fit that bill perfectly.\\n\\nBut what remains an interesting trend to follow is how Ganguly gives back in the bargain. Him clinching the president\\'s post can be seen as a victory for the Anurag Thakur-led group with a larger political angle connected. But he has often been a man of his own mind, and has changed allegiance for convenience in the past - within cricket and even politically.\\n\\nNonetheless, whatever happens from here, for now the old guard are back. This time, with their kids. For the love of the game.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

I started as a young kid playing the game I loved for fun and I could only dream of becoming a professional cricketer,\" Gunn was quoted as saying by the ECB.\\n\\nThe high points of her career have been the triad of World Cup triumphs, and five Ashes series wins. Gunn debuted at the age of 18 for England in 2004, against South Africa, in England\\'s first ever T20 international match. Gunn, in fact, was the first cricketer - male or female - to play 100 T20Is. She ends her career as England\\'s third-highest T20I wicket-taker and the second-highest in ODI cricket.\\n\\nGunn was also the vice-captain of the limited-overs side between 2010 and 2014, and led the side three times in the absence of Charlotte Edwards who, incidentally, happens to be the only female cricketer with more England caps than Gunn.\\n\\nGunn reflected on her long and distinguished career at the top and rates her World Cup medals to be her most prized possessions. Gunn hails from a sporting family - her father, Bryn, was a part of the Nottingham Forest Football Club when they won the European Cup in 1980. Gunn has certainly followed in his footsteps in the sporting realm.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been lucky enough to play in some great teams and to be part of some amazing battles over the years but as a small girl I always said I wanted to put a World Cup medal next to my dad\\'s European Cup winner\\'s medal, and there are now three of them next to his medal on the mantelpiece!\"\\n\\nClare Connor, Managing Director of England Women\\'s Cricket expressed her gratitude towards Gunn and thanked her for her services to the team: \"Jenny has been the most tremendous servant to England Women\\'s cricket throughout the 15 years she has played for England. Her longevity, work ethic and commitment have been hugely impressive across both the amateur and professional eras and on countless occasions she has delivered match-winning performances for the team with both bat and ball.\"\\n\\nGunn was a subtle seam bowler, who bothered batters the world over with her unpredictable variations off the wicket and her consistent probing lengths. She was called for chucking multiple times, but was cleared on account of \"extreme hyperextension\", causing the illusion of chucking. She continued to take wickets with her modified action and additionally, became increasing useful with the bat towards the middle years of her career, grabbing her opportunity to open with both hands and even carrying out a few blockathons to save Test matches.\\n\\n\"I\\'m so grateful for the support throughout my career and I couldn\\'t have done it without my friends. But most of all, I couldn\\'t have done it without my family, all of whom have been there for me every step of the way.\"\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nEngland Women Jenny Gunn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

Should that happen, highly placed sources in Indian cricket administration told TOI: \"BCCI will not sign the Members\\' Participation Agreement (MPA) with the ICC.\"\\n\\nFormer BCCI presidents Anurag Thakur and N Srinivasan - who clearly do not agree with Manohar\\'s style of functioning - are in no mood to relent this time. Once the new office-bearers assume office on October 23, the BCCI looks all set to resume its long-standing wrangle with the world governing body.\\n\\n\"In 2017, India came close to terminating their Members\\' Participation Agreement with the ICC ahead of the Champions Trophy, before the COA intervened. The ICC chairman should not forget that this time there won\\'t be any such hindrance. India\\'s interests at the ICC cannot be ignored and they (ICC) can\\'t be going ahead with this (FTP) when the BCCI is busy restructuring. What\\'s the hurry?\" a top BCCI official told TOI.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Sawhney is learnt to have sidelined chief executives from the member boards to push forward the FTP and place it on the agenda for the board meeting.\\n\\nIndia\\'s representative at the ICC, Amitabh Choudhary, who has been barred by the Committee of Administrators from carrying his duties (due to a legal case), landed in Dubai on Saturday evening.\\n\\n\"Obviously he has landed there at the behest of Shashank. In his absence, BCCI wouldn\\'t have been a participant. But he\\'s there now and should he abstain from voting against the FTP, ICC will have enough votes from members like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh and South Africa to see it through,\" said sources.\\n\\nBCCI CEO Rahul Johri, also present at the chief executives meeting, is learnt to have opposed Sawhney\\'s decision and informed the ICC that \"BCCI elections are presently underway and it will only be prudent for the new board members to deliberate and provide their inputs on this issue before any final decision is taken.\"\\n\\nBut the question that members of the BCCI back home are asking is if it is already too less and too late?\\n\\nThe idea behind Sawhney\\'s pursuit for a World Cup every three years and a World T20 every alternate year is believed to be maximization of revenue. \"But what\\'s the point of this revenue if it ends up driving a wedge in world cricket and its biggest stakeholders?\" sources add.\\n\\n© TNN\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

Also on the T20I comeback trail is wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin.\\n\\nKing, the 24-year-old opening batsman who was a ninth-round pick in the CPL draft, took the tournament by storm smashing 496 runs to lead Amazon Guyana Warriors' unprecedented 11-match winning streak, which was eventually snapped in the final by the Barbados Tridents.\\n\\nThe Tridents had their own little-known entity turned sensation in leg-spinner Walsh, who has played international cricket for USA. And now, after a dream run of 22 wickets in 9 matches at the CPL, he finds himself in the West Indies outfit.\\n\\nJoining the pair of King and Walsh Jr. in using the CPL as a launchpad is all-rounder Romario Shepherd, who has been picked only in the ODI squad. King's teammate at Guyana, Shepherd's most prominent role was with the ball, but he also showed glimpses of his big-hitting abilities too in the limited chances he got.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Carlos Brathwaite's fortunes have taken quite a downturn. From being the captain in West Indies' previous T20I assignment against India, he has now failed to find a place at all in both the ODI and T20I squads. Also notably missing from the India series is Sunil Narine, whose exclusion may have to do with the finger injury he picked up during the CPL. There's no Chris Gayle either, who appeared to be making his farewell after being dismissed in the third ODI against India but didn't confirm a potential retirement. Andre Russell is missing as well.\\n\\nWest Indies' Test squad, in comparison to the the drastic overhaul of the white-ball set-up, is relatively familiar with Jason Holder in charge. Although that hasn't left them immune to change, especially in the bowling department where Alzarri Joseph makes his return - to all formats - along with left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican, whereas Shannon Gabriel is out injured.\\n\\nDarren Bravo is the notable exclusion from the batting department, with the left-hander having scored only 47 runs in the Test series against India.\\n\\nThe Afghanistan-West Indies series, which will be played in Dehradun in India, gets underway with the three-match T20I series on November 5, 7 and 9. This is followed by three ODIs on November 13, 16 and 18, after which the two teams will play the one-off Test from November 27 to December 1.\\n\\nWest Indies T20I squad: Kieron Pollard (c), Nicholas Pooran, Evin Lewis, Brandon King, Shimron Hetmyer, Sherfane Rutherford, Jason Holder, Lendl Simmons, Fabian Allen, Hayden Walsh Jr., Khary Pierre, Sheldon Cottrell, Denesh Ramdin, Kesrick Williams, Alzarri Joseph\\n\\nODI squad: Kieron Pollard (c), Shai Hope, Evin Lewis, Shimron Hetmyer, Sunil Ambris, Nicholas Pooran, Brandon King, Roston Chase, Jason Holder, Hayden Walsh Jr., Khary Pierre, Sheldon Cottrell, Keemo Paul, Romario Shepherd, Alzarri Joseph\\n\\nTest squad: Jason Holder (c), Shai Hope, John Campbell, Kraigg Brathwaite, Shimron Hetmyer, Shamarh Brooks, Roston Chase, Shane Dowrich, Sunil Ambris, Jomel Warrican, Rahkeem Cornwall, Kemar Roach, Keemo Paul, Alzarri Joseph\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nWest Indies Brandon King Hayden Walsh Afghanistan v West Indies in India, 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

Simmons, who was among three short-listed candidates, saw off the competition from Desmond Haynes and Floyd Reifer.\\n\\nSimmons was axed as West Indies coach in September 2016 - six months after West Indies clinched the World T20 title for the second time - with the board citing \"differences in cultural and strategic approach\". As coach of the Afghanistan team, he saw them qualify for their maiden World Cup in 2019 while he was also at the helm when Barbados Tridents won the CPL title on Sunday. Earlier, Simmons had also coached the Ireland team.\\n\\n\"Bringing Phil Simmons back is not just righting a past wrong, but I am confident that CWI has chosen the right man for the job at the right time. I want to also thank the very talented Floyd Reifer for the hard work he put in while he was the interim coach,\" said Ricky Skerritt, the CWI president.\\n\\nJimmy Adams, CWI\\'s Director of Cricket, who was also part of the interview panel for screening the candidates, said: \"I am happy, after a very robust recruitment process at the appointment of Phil to the role of Head Coach. I have no doubt that Phil brings the requisite leadership skills and experience needed to drive improvement across our international squads and I look forward to supporting him in the role.\"\\n\\nFollowing a meeting of board of directors on Monday (October 14), Cricket West Indies also announced the selection panels for the men, women, boys and girls\\' teams. Former West Indies cricketer Roger Harper was named as chief of the men\\'s panel, which also includes Miles Bascombe. Ann Browne-John was named head the women\\'s and girls\\' selection panel while Robert Haynes was appointed Talent ID Manager of the boys\\' panel.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

But a couple of run-outs combined with Sohail Tanvir's three-fer put paid to all hopes of a decent target.\\n\\nIn reply, Nothern got off to a sticky start against a fired-up Mohammad Irfan who made a couple of quick inroads. But Umar Amin's half-century steadied the ship, before Asif Ali shut the door on the opposition with a quickfire 44 off just 24 balls, even as Zahid Mahmood threatened a late comeback with a lovely spell of 2/14.\\n\\nBrief Scores: Southern Punjab 135-9 in 20 overs (Aamer Yamin 33, Sohaib Maqsood 25; Sohail Tanvir 3-27, Mohammad Amir 2-19) lost to Northern 137-5 in 19 overs (Asif Ali 44, Umar Amin 50, Mohammad Nawaz 24; Mohammad Irfan 2-19, Zahid Mahmood 2-14) by five wickets.\\n\\nBalochistan vs Sindh\\n\\nA massive score of 233 proved more than enough for Balochistan as they opened their account in the tournament with a 52-run win over Sindh. Their opening pair of Imam-ul-Haq and Awais Zia had blazed off in the powerplay, which fetched over 60 runs. Even Imam's dismissal for 25 did nothing to stop Zia, and more importantly, the run-rate, as he found a willing partner in Bismillah Khan.\\n\\nThe duo smashed half-centuries each, taking the Sindh bowlers to the sword in a 99-run stand for the second wicket. Unfortunately, the misery wasn't to end there. Amad Butt swooped in with a late cameo of his own, spiking the total to 233. Amidst all this, Mohammad Hasnain may have picked up three wickets but he also went for 42 in his four overs.\\n\\nSindh got off to a blazing start of their own, but the dash upfront from Abid Ali and Khurram Manzoor was shortlived and couldn't seep into the rest of the lineup. Twin three-fers from Akif Javed and Amad Butt further dented the chase. So by the time Sarfaraz Ahmed got going, it was destined to be a lost cause.\\n\\nBrief scores: Balochistan 233-6 in 20 overs (Awais Zia 77, Bismillah Khan 54, Amad Butt 31; Mohammad Hasnain 3-42) beat Sindh 181 all-out in 19.4 overs (Abid Ali 41, Sarfaraz Ahmed 36, Khurram Manzoor 33, Saud Shakeel 28, Ahsan Ali 23; Amad Butt 3-32, Akif Javed 3-42) by 52 runs.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

The track is now in a race against time to be ready for the Australia Domestic One-Day Cup Clash against the visitors.\\n\\nThe reason for the damage, according to NSW, was Sydney Roosters practice session in the lead up to the NRL grand final. \"It is a great disappointment to our players and everyone at Cricket NSW that we can no longer play there over the next week,\" Lee Germon, Cricket NSW chief executive, said.\\n\\n\"Our male players were looking forward to playing four of their five home Shield matches and a one-day match at the SCG this season, something that has rarely happened over the past decade or so. Our off-season training and planning was based squarely around the fact that most of our matches would be at the SCG this season, creating an extra buzz of excitement.\\n\\n\"It is important that our current and future international cricketers have the opportunity to play as much cricket as possible on the SCG.\"\\n\\nThe SCG Trust, however, stressed the damage wasn\\'t because of the training session, according to the report in cricket.com.au.

It\\'s all equally divided,\" said Vinod Rai. © Agencies\\n\\nVinod Rai, the Committee of Administrators chief, has hit back at his colleague Diana Edulji\\'s remark that her views were not taken into consideration by the Supreme Court-appointed body as she is always in the minority.\\n\\nEdulji, in an interview with The Indian Express, had said, \"Maybe they (referring to CoA members) think of me as too junior a person who doesn\\'t know much about cricket administration, but my views are always in the minority. Now, since there are three members in the CoA, 2-1, 2-1, 2-1 is the norm of the CoA...\\n\\n\"I\\'m (upset) because this is not the way the CoA is supposed to function. People have different views and we must be able to accept certain views of the minority also. When we were 1-1, the other opinion was taken and now it\\'s always 2-1.\"\\n\\nResponding to the remarks, Rai told Cricbuzz, \"We all have the right to give our views and we all have one vote to exercise that right. It\\'s all equally divided. In that case, it doesn\\'t matter how the final decision is reached, whether it is 2-1 or 3-0.\"\\n\\nEdulji had also said that there wasn\\'t uniformity in the manner in which state associations were treated by the CoA for the election process and that different yardstick were used for different states. She also pointed at the manner in which Manipur Cricket Association was disqualified from the electoral roll for the upcoming BCCI elections, as its representative, Rajkumar Imo Singh, was discharging a public duty (Congress MLA), while Delhi and District Cricket Association wasn\\'t pulled up for the same when more than 25 complaints were received against their representation. The main point of contention was that the association had OP Sharma, an MLA from Delhi, as the treasurer of the body.\\n\\nHowever, Rai countered that allegation by stating that, \"It\\'s quite clear. For Manipur, the nominee was in violation of the rules. That was not the case with DDCA\\'s nominee.\"\\n\\nEdulji had claimed that CoA had allowed three states - Bihar, Uttarakhand and Odisha - an extension to register their constitution, while the same luxury was not afforded to the likes of TNCA, HCA and MCA. Denying a biased approach towards it, Rai said, \"They were given the same extension like every other association to comply with the reforms and have their constitutions registered. The last date for all associations was the same.\"\\n\\nHe also deferred the point over the exclusion of the three government bodies - Services, Railways and Indian Universities - from the electoral roll by adding \"That was a call taken by the Electoral Officer and not the CoA.\"\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nIndia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarkram ruled out of Ranchi Test with fractured wrist\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJozi Stars sign up Shoaib Malik for MSL 2019\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBangladesh receive Tamim injury scare ahead of India tour\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Ganguly going to be a BCCI president with a difference?\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGus Logie named interim head coach of West Indies women\\'s team\\n\\n6h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill discuss Dhoni\\'s future with selectors - Ganguly\\n\\n7h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

The Indian captain is 50 games old into his leadership job and has 30 wins to show for.\\n\\nHis current side, packed with experience, has bagged for India a home series record - of 11 successive series wins - beating peak Australian sides of the 1990s and 2000s to it. The 2013 home series against Australia became the starting point for this absolute juggernaut that is going to take some stopping even from here.\\n\\nIn 2019, India have four wins in four, while South Africa sit at the other end of the success spectrum with zilch to show for. Before losing to India in Vizag and Pune, they conceded two home Tests to Sri Lanka and then lost Dale Steyn and Hashim Amla to retirement and Duanne Olivier to Kolpak. Du Plessis\\'s team has run around in an inferiority circle in India, trying but failing to break away from it. Virat Kohli & Co. came away looking head and shoulders above the South African batsmen, also because India\\'s bowlers did a far superior job than their counterparts.\\n\\nDu Plessis pointed fingers at the gulf between the two sides with respect to consistency and experience. India weren\\'t just a step ahead of South Africa at most times, but also knew how to regain lost ground as soon as the visitors would show any sign of composure. These two Tests weren\\'t the kind where the visitors were made to bite the dust in hostile conditions. Far from it.\\n\\nSouth Africa arrived at the back of an exodus of experience and a home series embarrassment at the hands of Sri Lanka. The expectation was for India to run them over for easy World Test Championship points, but Dean Elgar and Quinton de Kock showed that defiance can make mincemeat of any prediction. But sustenance of this defiance is where the visitors fell way short. In the face of a tricky Day 5 pitch with the ball keeping low, South African batsmen just couldn\\'t fight it out one more time. In Pune, the inconsistency carried on while India raised their game a notch.\\n\\n\"You can take player by player in the two teams and the ability to land the ball in the right areas for a long period of time... they [Indian bowlers] do that as a bowling attack together. I find that in the first and the second Test there were periods when we did it, with Vernon [Philander] and KG [Rabada] and a little bit of Keshav [Maharaj] sometimes where there is pressure building and we managed to keep the run rate at a good tempo at 2.8 or 2.9. But then the pressure just gets released and their batting is on top and it is difficult to stop. The way the Indian batters have taken the game to our bowlers in both the Test matches [is incredible],\" Du Plessis said in a post-match press conference.\\n\\nDu Plessis is right. Inconsistency plagues this South African side, and even with bowlers like Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada and Keshav Maharaj - whose reputation has seen quite a spike in recent times, they\\'ve struggled to win entire sessions by putting Indian batsmen under pressure.\\n\\nThough it\\'d be unfair to compare the two sides in their current forms, it\\'s telling of the sheer gulf in abilities that India are employing a strict but unspoken perform-or-perish policy even for their inexperienced players (like Rishabh Pant for example) while South Africa have no choice but to go down this route: \"For us it is important as a senior player group to make sure that we put in performances ourselves. Myself, Deano, QdK... we can\\'t expect other guys. We need to make sure we make the runs first and then the others guys to chip in with us. In a time like this, it is important that your big guys really, really take control and make sure that they put in the bulk of the work.\"\\n\\n\"When it comes to this Indian team, there\\'s a lot of experience in that dressing room, there\\'s a lot of Test matches behind their names. We\\'re at this stage where we\\'ve lost almost all of our experience. Steyn, Morkel, Amla, de Villiers all of them are seasoned campaigners. And now its a new group of guys who\\'ve played 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 15 Test matches. That will take time. You don\\'t replace those guys overnight. If you take the best players out of any team, they would find the same challenges.\\n\\n\"If you look at their team in terms of Test caps, and experience, and the numbers they have on the board in terms of averages, it all stacks up. That\\'s where we\\'ve got to get at as a team. If you look at, from our batting point of view, purely on the numbers side of things it\\'s not good enough. So we need to get there. We need the right guys to make sure there\\'s a plan for the next two years. Obviously the Test championship is not now, it\\'s a two year thing, so we\\'ve to make sure we get there, and all batting averages are 40 plus. And if you do that, then consistently you will challenge bowling attacks.\"\\n\\nThe thing about consistency and experience is that it\\'s interwoven - you need the former to gain the latter, while the existence of the latter breeds the former. So where and how do South Africa begin then?\\n\\nEven as Du Plessis has maintained a straight face while talking about improving his performance at the toss, the starting point - particularly in this series - should be their batting.\\n\\nAiden Markram made his way to Vizag with two centuries in India - for the A side and in the warm-up game. Hitting the straps right before the series was timing at its best as far as South Africa could imagine, as they needed a top-order batsman to carry the weight of run-making in the absence of Hashim Amla. Two weeks on, Markram heads for the last Test of the series with scores of 5 and 39 in the first Test and a pair in the second.\\n\\nTheunis de Bruyn is next in the top-order who has high hopes pinned on him. His decision to shun a life pursuing Chartered Accountancy and play cricket for the country instead saw a moment of vindication last year, when he scored a backs-to-the-wall century in Sri Lanka, albeit in a defeat.\\n\\nHis role in India was meant to ease the pressure on the out-of-sorts No.4 Temba Bavuma and ensure Du Plessis didn\\'t have to swoop in and hold the South African innings together. De Bruyn heads to Ranchi with scores of 4, 10, 30 and 8, and is under the risk of remaining on the bench there. Temba Bavuma admitting that his best efforts in this series is not good enough says a lot about what he\\'s going through and taking his team through while occupying a crucial position at two-drop.\\n\\nLike du Plessis admitted, South Africa are indeed at a juncture where the seniors need to hand-hold the inexperienced as they aim to move forward together. But even for that to happen, the captain needs his players to at least meet him midway as far as the performances are concerned.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nSouth Africa tour of India, 2019, 2nd TestSouth Africa tour of India, 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRELATED STORIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKohli two points away from overtaking Smith in Test rankings\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith chances few and far between, Umesh makes it count in Pune\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia\\'s record-breaking sequence at home\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaharaj ruled out of Ranchi Test with shoulder injury\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecord-breaking India take unassailable 2-0 lead\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhilander, Maharaj combine again to delay India\\'s victory march\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

In every sphere of BCB\\'s game development, it is a common notion that foreign coaches will be in a leading position while the locals will act as their helping hand. The same is the case with the national team\\'s dressing room, which is filled with overseas coaching staff due to the fact the BCB higher-ups believe they are the best bet.\\n\\nThere were exceptions with Khaled Mahmud taking on the role on an interim basis but that seemed to be more of a stop-gap arrangement more than anything else. And with how those stints turned out, it seems like there is hardly any place for local coaches in the national set-up. Yet, local coaches had the opportunity to prove their mettle as they had the chance to stack up against foreign coaches in the Bangladesh Premier League - the lone franchise-based Twenty20 competition of the country.\\n\\nHowever, given that the BCB decided to abandon the tournament for the time being due to the unreasonable demand of the franchises and instead opted to host Bangabandhu BPL, the future of local coaches was left facing a dilemma.\\n\\nThe announcement made by the BPL governing council recently suggested that local coaches could only work as assistants to foreign head coaches in the upcoming edition of BPL, which aggravated matters further. That, despite the fact that local coaches have shown a considerable amount of success in BPL, winning three titles in six editions of the tournament.\\n\\nMohammad Salahuddin, known to be the best in the business and considered as the mentor of several leading national stars including the likes of Shakib al Hasan and Mominul Haque, has guided Comilla Victorians to the championship on two occasions, while Khaled Mahmud led Dhaka Dynamites to the title glory once. In the other three editions, Ian Pont led Dhaka Gladiators twice, while Tom Moody had success with Rangpur Riders once.\\n\\nSalahuddin, surprised with the entire turn of events, showed his disappointment through a post on his Facebook page where he lambasted the BCB.\\n\\n\\'\\'Today I realized that the standard of local coaches are not good. Trainers are not up to the mark while the physios were joking for so long. Everywhere foreigners will come is good then why don\\'t you bring any foreign directors for BCB, it is alright that the coach trainer and physios are not of international standard then how come you [ directors] think that you are of international standard. You are all like us. You should bring foreign directors,\\'\\' he wrote in his Facebook post.\\n\\nOne of the leading local coaches, Nazmul Abedin, left BCB this October after serving the board for 14 long years in a different capacity. One of the major reasons behind his decision was that his position was being handed to overseas personnel with each passing day in various capacities.\\n\\nNazmul believes that this decision of the BCB of only foreign coaches manning teams in the BPL will have a negative impact on the mindset of the local coaches and even more on the ones who want to take up coaching as a profession.\\n\\n\\'\\'This coming November we will be celebrating 20 years in Test cricket and I am really scared that we have not been able to produce a good coach and that just shows how bad the situation we are in at the moment. I do not know the logic behind this decision because local coaches have done well in the last couple of editions,\\'\\' said Nazmul on Friday (October 11).\\n\\n\\'\\'This kind of decision will certainly discourage the local coaches who really want to see themselves in a higher position and I do not think anybody will be very eager to coach and they might look for other alternatives,\\'\\' he said.\\n\\n\\'\\'I really do think BCB believes that we don\\'t have qualified coaches despite there are two to four persons who have the coaching ability. For some reason they do not want to employ those coaches and this is a questionable decision for such a big organization,\\'\\' he said.\\n\\nFormer national head coach Sarowar Imran, who also had the privilege to lead different sides in the BPL, looked to be totally bemused with this unexpected decision of BCB.\\n\\n\\'\\'I am disappointed. There is no country in the world that says there is no place for local coaches for head coach position,\\'\\' said Sarowar.\\n\\nBangladesh coaches have had a lot of success in the BPL. Last year, the two finalists Dhaka Dynamites and Comilla Victorians were coached by locals.\\n\\n\\'\\'I have played a final with a bad team in 2012. Barisal Burners lost to Dhaka in the final. In 2016, Rajshahi Kings played final with a normal side and we lost to Dhaka,\\'\\' he said. \\'\\'Salahuddin won two times while Khaled Mahmud won once and these results prove the credentials of local coaches,\\'\\' he said.\\n\\nAccording to BCB cricket operations chairman Akram Khan, who is also a member of the BPL governing council, all is not lost for local coaches as he assured that their issues will be raised in the next BPL governing council meeting.\\n\\n\"It is not like all the seven coaches will be foreign. I was not present in the last meeting [of BPL governing council] but my question is those who have done well why they won\\'t have a chance. Even they can have a chance and it is totally dependent on the next meeting because nothing has been finalized yet. We will make a decision at that point and those [coaches] who have done well naturally their name will be considered,\\'\\' Akram told reporters at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Saturday (October 12) when asked about the chances of having local coaches in the BPL.\\n\\nWhether or not the BPL governing council changes its mind regarding the head coaches in the tournament, will be known in the coming days. But they have certainly given a clear message that there is hardly any place for local coaches in the longer scheme of things, which is surprising considering that other cricketing nations are inclined to develop their local coaches.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarkram ruled out of Ranchi Test with fractured wrist\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJozi Stars sign up Shoaib Malik for MSL 2019\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBangladesh receive Tamim injury scare ahead of India tour\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Ganguly going to be a BCCI president with a difference?\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGus Logie named interim head coach of West Indies women\\'s team\\n\\n6h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill discuss Dhoni\\'s future with selectors - Ganguly\\n\\n7h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

The former India captain will officially take charge as the new BCCI president on October 23, the day of the BCCI elections.\\n\\nSpeaking after filing his nomination, Ganguly referred to the \"emergency\" situation in BCCI over the last three years, which saw intervention from the Supreme Court of India and the appointment of a Committee of Administrators to oversee administrative affairs. The former India captain stressed that \"getting the house in order\" is first on his priority.\\n\\n\"I wasn\\'t aware (of my name announcement) until 10:30pm yesterday. Even when I became captain in 2000, there were issues going around. It\\'s always great to be looked at as someone who can do things in difficult situations,\" Ganguly said. \"It\\'s a very important time in Indian cricket administration, given what\\'s happened in the last three years. There was an emergency situation, which the members have overcome.\\n\\n\"This eight-man team, announced by Rajiv Shukla, will try and get BCCI back in order. To be in a position where I can make a difference along with the team would be extremely satisfying. Hopefully in the next few months, we can put everything in place and bring back normalcy in Indian cricket.\\n\\n\"As a team, we have a lot of things to do. To get administration in order, get the house, the office in order. Cricket on the field has been brilliant. Team has played exceptionally well after the semifinal exit. Good cricket depends on the infrastructure and the backroom work, and it\\'s our job at the back to make sure that everything is in the right frame and position so that the boys can excel.\\n\\nTalking about his other priorities as the new BCCI president, Ganguly mentioned an increased focus on first-class cricket and cricketers, which will start with a manifold increase in the remuneration for them.\\n\\n\"For me, my biggest focus will be first-class cricket,\" Ganguly revealed. \"I have been very vocal about looking after the first-class players, especially the time they invest. First-class cricket is the base, the strength. I have written so many times in the last few years that the remunerations need to increase, and increase manifold. So that\\'s going to be priority to set the fc cricket in order. Look at cricket structure, look how governance happens and see smooth functioning happens with no issues.\"\\n\\nOne of the other issues Ganguly touched upon was BCCI\\'s weakened position in the ICC. \"We have not received money that we deserve from the ICC in the last three-four years. We generate 70-75 percent in revenues. That\\'s one of the agenda, surely,\" he said.\\n\\nGanguly also said that the role of BCCI President wasn\\'t something he actively pursued, but is instead taking up the job after he was recommended by the senior people in the BCCI set-up.\\n\\n\"I never spoke to anyone, have never expressed that I was keen. 90% of representatives in BCCI at the moment in administration are new. In the current constitution, the way it is framed, a lot of people are tentative even to decide on positions in the BCCI. Because if it\\'s not good enough, if it\\'s not a position you can make a difference, they didn\\'t want to take it. Because they will lose state associations positions.\"\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nSourav Ganguly\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

It was the end of the perfect run for Warriors as they lost their fifth final after 11 consecutive wins. Jonathan Carter's late blitz gave Tridents 171 for 6 before Ashley Nurse - with figures of 4-0-17-2 - sealed the chase for them by restricting Warriors to 144 for 9.\\n\\nAfter the coin fell in Jason Holder's favour, Alex Hales and Johnson Charles gave Tridents a steady start as they scored 43 in the first five overs before the former fell to Romario Shepherd in the last over of the powerplay. There was another jolt soon after as Philip Salt, playing his first game of the tournament, was dismissed for a duck by Romario Shepherd. Shai Hope laboured for 12 balls for his eight while Shakib al Hasan was dismissed for a run-a-ball 15.\\n\\nJason Holder too made an early exit as two runs outs - of Shakib and the Tridents captain by Keemo Paul - left the team hurting at 108 for 6 in the 15th over. Carter, though, was in no mood to give up as he slammed a 27-ball 50 and scored 63 in the last 5.1 overs with Nurse. Carter got going with two boundaries against Imran Tahir and then moved steadily to 32 off 20. Paul then was struck for two sixes and a four as Tridents raced past 150. The final over from Shepherd started on a poor note as picked up a four and six and then completed his half-century off 26 balls to give the bowlers a fighting chance.\\n\\nWarriors kept losing wickets and failed to build any sort of momentum to threaten Tridents. After the early loss of Chandrapaul Hemraj, Shimron Hetmyer gave the side some hope when he struck a Jason Holder for a six. However, Raymon Reifer (4 for 24) quickly brought an end to Hetmyer's aggressive approach in the fourth over with 30 on the board. Shoaib Malik made 4 off 11 while Nicholas Pooran managed 24 off 25.\\n\\nBrandon King made 43 off 33 but the struggle of the middle order meant they were left with too much to do in the last four overs with 67 more needed. Paul did get some hits in - scoring 25 off 14 - but Harry Gurney and Reifer kept tightening the noose to deliver the title.\\n\\nBrief scores: Barbados Tridents 171/6 in 20 overs (Jonathan Carter 50*; Imran Tahir 1-24) beat Guyana Amazon Warriors 144/9 in 20 overs (Brandon King 43; Raymon Reifer 4-24) by 27 runs.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nCaribbean Premier League 2019, Final Caribbean Premier League 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRELATED STORIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCPL 2019 - Team of the tournament\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerfect Warriors look to set right an imperfect reputation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll-round Nurse takes Barbados Tridents into CPL final\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrandon King century takes Guyana Amazon Warriors to CPL 2019 final\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNarine, Pollard take Trinbago Knight Riders into Qualifier\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRuthless Amazon Warriors register 10th successive win\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarkram ruled out of Ranchi Test with fractured wrist\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJozi Stars sign up Shoaib Malik for MSL 2019\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBangladesh receive Tamim injury scare ahead of India tour\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Ganguly going to be a BCCI president with a difference?\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGus Logie named interim head coach of West Indies women's team\\n\\n6h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill discuss Dhoni's future with selectors - Ganguly\\n\\n7h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

Bengal won the toss and elected to bat at the Sawai Man Singh stadium in Jaipur, and were aided by a 75-run partnership between Shreevats Goswami and Abhishek Raman at the top. However, the middle-order failed to make any significant contribution, as Bengal failed to play out their fifty overs to end with 223 on the board. Railways openers Pratham Singh and Mrunal Devdhar got their team off to a fluent start with an 82-run partnership, and it looked like they would cruise to a clinical win. However, after the wicket of Pratham Singh (91), a dramatic collapse ensued as the Railways lost 6 wickets for 29 runs to end the game in a dramatic tie with a run-out off the final ball.\\n\\nNail-biters\\n\\nDelhi defeated Punjab by 5 runs in a closely-fought encounter in Baroda, after Punjab asked them to bat first. After the top-order failed, the middle-order resisted but couldn't notch up a significant score, and it was left up to No. 8 Lalit Yadav to save Delhi the blushes with a fifty. Siddarth Kaul was the pick of with bowlers with 5 wickets for 37 runs. After a good start to the chase, there was a mini-collapse but Punjab showed resistance through a 90-run stand between Anmolpreet Singh and Sharad Lumba. After the wicket of Lumba, however, Punjab lost 5 wickets for just 30 runs to concede the match by 5 runs.\\n\\nBaroda defeated Himachal Pradesh in a nail-biter of a contest in Vadodara by 2 wickets. After Baroda won the toss and opted to bowl, their decision was proved right almost immediately after the 57-run opening stand, as the visitors lost their remaining wickets for just 104 runs and were skittled out for a sub-par 161. Baroda's chase, however, was extremely poorly executed, with no batsman showing enough character to stay put at the crease. In the end, No. 3 Swapnil Singh saved Baroda the blushes at home, scoring an unbeaten 66, and stitched a 30-run 9th wicket stand with Rishi Arothe to drag the hosts across the line by 2 wickets.\\n\\nNagaland defeated Chandigarh by one wicket in a thrilling encounter in Dehradun. After being asked to bat first, Chandigarh's batsmen put up a poor show with the willow, and it was left up to the lower-order to do some face-saving for the team. The tail obliged, adding 103 runs for the 8th and 9th wicket, including a gutsy 55 by Ankit Kaushik and a stoic 49 by Bipul Sharma to drag Chandigarh to 220. The chase began rather shakily as Nagaland were reduced to 20-3 but Shrikant Mundhe and opener Aosashi Longchar added 102 for the 5th wicket before another collapse ensued and reduced them to 213 for 9. Eventually, Shresth Nirmohi's five-wicket haul went in vain as Temjentoshi and Lemtur managed to push Nagaland across the line in a stunning one-wicket win.\\n\\nOne-man shows\\n\\nPriyam Garg, who contributed 120 runs to Uttar Pradesh's total of 211 against Vidarbha, outscored what the rest of his teammates put together as well as the opposition team, as Uttar Pradesh crushed Vidarbha by 109 runs in Vadodara. The knock was clearly an outlier, with the next best score in the match being notched up by the opposition's No. 9 batsman, Darshan Nalkande (26). The only other UP batsman who got into double-figures happened to be Shivam Mavi (20), who stitched together a crucial 65-run stand with Garg.\\n\\nThe Uttar Pradesh vs. Vidarbha clash also witnessed a stunning spell of bowling from Saurabh Kumar to complement Priyam Garg's hundred, as he ripped through the Vidarbha batting line-up, with a conspicuous 6 wickets for 25 runs on a scorecard that didn't see any other bowler pick up more than 3 wickets. Kumar's early dismissal of the experienced Wasim Jaffer was a crucial point in the chase, as it exposed the less seasoned middle-order and brought about a panicked collapse.\\n\\nSteamrollers\\n\\nPuducherry vs. Manipur: In a no-contest of a league match in Dehradun that lasted all of 46.2 overs across innings, Vinay Kumar and Sagar Udeshi ripped the heart out of Manipur's batting line-up, who folded for 109 in 30.1 overs. Puducherry didn't need to break a sweat during the run-chase, powered by a violent 43-ball 67 from Arun Karthik, as raced to the target in 97 balls, with the game lasting only marginally longer than a completed T20 game.\\n\\nGujarat vs. Jammu and Kashmir: Gujarat continued their unbeaten run in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, after coming up against Jammu and Kashmir at the KL Saini Ground in Jaipur. After Gujarat won the toss and opted to bowl, Jammu and Kashmir's middle-order contributed with a slew of half-centuries to set a steep target of 280. Gujarat, though, were clinical in their chase and made a mockery of the J&K bowling, with Parthiv Patel (63 off 36) and Bhargav Merai (70* off 56) pummelling half-centuries and Priyank Panchal blazing away to a fluent 135 (off 122 balls).\\n\\nAssam vs. Meghalaya: Assam steamrolled Meghalaya by 6 wickets in Dehradun, after flattening their batting line-up (100 all-out), with Dwaraka Ravi Teja (51*) outscoring the remainder of his teammates combined. Roshan Alam picked up 4 wickets but Arup Das was the pick of the bowlers for ripping through the top-order with his new-ball spell. Assam's chase didn't get off to a smooth start but Sibasankar Roy, the skipper, was in a no-nonsense mood and struck a 54-ball 69 to take his team through within 18 overs.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nVijay Hazare Trophy 2019-20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRELATED STORIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAzim Kazi's all-round brilliance helps Maharashtra enter Top 5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSamson's record double ton powers Kerala to massive win\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVijay Hazare Highlights: Delhi lose despite Rana's allround efforts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKarnataka withstand Dube assault to clinch thriller\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVijay Hazare Highlights: Tamil Nadu stretch winning run to seven games\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

Batting first, India could muster only 146 runs but the spinners combined to claim nine wickets and defend the lowly score for their first series whitewash in the format since the one against West Indies in 2016. Incidentally, the notorious trend of conceding the final game of the series started in South Africa in early 2018 and comes to a halt against the same opposition.\\n\\nUnlike India though, it were the pace trioka of Marizanne Kapp, Shabnim Ismail and Ayabonga Khaka that did the bulk of damage to keep India to just 146. South Africa were also phenomenal in the field, in sharp contrast to how the earlier two games went for the visitors. Unfortunately, the batting couldn't match up.\\n\\nIsmail and Kapp struck in their very first overs, sending back Priya Punia for her maiden ODI duck and Rodrigues for just three, respectively. Punam Raut and Mithali Raj combined to offer some resistance but found scoring difficult. Khaka opened her account by sending back Raut for 15, while Raj became Kapp's second victim after having chipped in just 11 off 46.\\n\\nHarmanpreet Kaur then held one end up, but kept losing partners at the other end quite regularly. Shikha Pandey gave her company for a 49-run stand that bailed India out when they were reeling at 71 for 6 in the 30th over. The seventh-wicket partnership was the best of India's innings, before the vice-captain was bowled by Kapp in the 39th over. Pandey made the second best score of 35 off 40 deliveries, while Mansi Joshi's twin boundaries fetched India some bonus runs towards the end.\\n\\nDespite Pandey squeezing out two maidens, the Indian pacers were tad expensive at the start. Joshi drew first blood when she took out the hard-hitting Lizelle Lee for 13. India brought spin on as early as in the eighth over and Ekta Bisht struck rightaway, taking out Trisha Chetty for 7. Mignon du Preez found a way past Bisht, hitting her for a couple of boundaries in the 12th over, but Deepti Sharma then had her caught off her bowling to lend South Africa another blow. Rajeshwari Gayakwad, too, picked up a wicket in her first over to leave the visitors reeling at 54 for 4 after 14 overs.\\n\\nSkipper Sune Luus and Kapp put on some resistance, adding 40 runs for the sixth wicket stand to frustrate the Indian bowlers for more than 13 overs. However, once the duo departed - six overs apart - it was always going to be an uphill task for the relatively inexperienced tail to pull it off. South Africa needed 28 more after Kapp's dismissal off the first ball of the 37th over, but Ismail and Nondumiso Shangase only delayed the inevitable.\\n\\nWhen Ismail fell to Harmanpreet, South Africa's last wicket pair still had to get nine more runs in 21 deliveries. But with India's all three frontline spinners bowled out, Raj resorted to the part-time offpsin of Rodrgiues, who picked up her maiden ODI wicket by dismissing Tumi Sekhukhune to bowl out the visitors for 140 for a thrilling finish to the series.\\n\\nBrief scores: India 146 in 45.5 overs (Harmanpreet Kaur 38, Shikha Pandey 35; Marizanne Kapp 3-20, Shabnim Ismail 2-18) beat South Africa 140 in 48 overs (Marizanne Kapp 29, Sune Luss 24; Ekta Bisht 3-32, Rajeshwari Gayakwad 2-22) by 6 runs.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nIndia Women South Africa Women South Africa Women tour of India, 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRELATED STORIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth Africa Women play for pride in dead rubber\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRaj, Raut star as India take ODI series\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDented South Africa aim to get level\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClinical India take 1-0 lead with comfortable win\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMandhana injury puts India's batting in focus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLee, Luus conspire to hand India big loss in Surat dead rubber\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

Their best show with the bat in the ongoing series thus far just wasn't good enough - such has been India's dominance on home soil. After Priya Punia and Jemimah Rodrigues's inspired victory in the series opener, India sealed the deal courtesy half-century knocks from Mithali Raj and Punam Raut, with finishing touches from vice-captain Harmanpreet Kaur on Friday.\\n\\nNow, for South Africa to up their game one more time and wrap up what has been an arduous tour with a consolation win in the third and final ODI at Vadodara on Monday (October 14).\\n\\nJust like in the final game of the preceding T20I series, South Africa's batting unit clicked in unison to help them to 247. But unlike in Surat, the bowlers couldn't capitalise on the early breakthroughs and let the game, and series, slip. To make matters worse, their fielding has come under the scanner too. An all-round show, inspired by the one in Surat, is what can save South Africa from the blushes of a whitewash.\\n\\nIt wasn't an ideal game for India on Friday either. The number of extras conceded in the second game, especially, would be a matter of grave concern for the team. The fielding lapses in the latter half of their bowling innings did have India chasing a stiff target. In the batting department, losing wickets in a heap in the middle overs allowed South Africa a comeback opportunity until Harmanpreet stepped up in her true-blue style to close out the game with two overs to spare. Raj admittedly wanted India to do better than that in all three departments. The hosts, undoubtedly, would be eyeing a clean sweep to boost their morale ahead of an away Championship series that's coming up against West Indies in November.\\n\\nIt's easier said than done though, for India have lately been guilty of letting their guard down in the third game after winning the series with the first two. Perhaps that's where their next biggest challenge lies. Fortunately, it's not a Championship game, so they can afford the freedom to experiment with those warming the bench, but it's imperative that they do so without taking their foot off the pedal.\\n\\nWhen: India vs South Africa, 3rd ODI on Monday, October 14 at 9 am IST | 3:30 am GMT\\n\\nWhere:Reliance Cricket Stadium, Vadodara\\n\\nWhat to expect:The humidity levels are dropping in Vadodara, but it's another hot day in store for the two teams with temperatures hovering in the late 30s. The pitch has been fantastic for batting and should continue to produce runs.\\n\\nTeam News\\n\\nIndia:With series in the bag already, this could be the home team's chance to explore their bench strength.

The prize money for the Men\\'s winners at the tournament stands at USD 1.6 million.

That was around a year ago against the West Indies. © AFP\\n\\nWith India\\'s fast-bowling stocks as rich as they are, it\\'s led to a situation that\\'s posing very different problems, probably of the ilk that no other Indian team management has ever faced before. Umesh Yadav had a 10-wicket haul in his previous home Test before Pune. That was around a year ago against the West Indies.\\n\\nSince then, the right-arm seamer has only played one more Test in Perth, out of a possible eight. In that period, the trio of Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammad Shami and Ishant Sharma have pretty much cemented themselves as the top dogs of the red-ball format.\\n\\nSo with the pecking order already established in the pace department, Umesh has been relegated to chance opportunities, like the one he was presented after the injury to Bumrah. The best he can do is to be ready when the chance arrives. And he certainly was ready in Pune, putting in a spirited performance to take twin 3-fers.\\n\\n\"This is part and parcel of the game, so these situations will keep coming but what I need to do in these situations is, even if I am not playing, I have to be ready for my chance,\" Umesh said on Sunday (October 13). \"For that, it is important to remain focused, positive. I try that whatever matches I play - Ranji, India A - I get good match time. More you play matches, better you get. Whatever you bowl in nets, when you play a match, you know what to bowl in a match and it becomes very important. It\\'s not in my hands. I can\\'t say that I will play all Test matches. All the bowlers are doing well, there is a healthy competition and everyone will get their chances at some point or other. I am ready for that and that\\'s my mindset.\"\\n\\nThis mindset referred to above is carefully cultivated over time. And it\\'s nurtured by playing matches in order to keep the rhythm and fitness going. After the tour of Australia earlier this year, Umesh played a stellar role in the quarters and the semifinals of the Ranji Trophy as Vidarbha marched to back-to-back titles. He then participated in the A tour of the West Indies, before warming the benches in India\\'s Test series win.\\n\\n\"When I didn\\'t play in the Windies, selectors put me in India A but when there is a big gap with ODIs, T20s, I have only told selectors that whatever match is there, please let me play as match practice is very important for me. The season that was there, it was off, no Ranji, so I told them I would like to play,\" Umesh said.\\n\\nHowever, there can only be so much match practice to be had. Apart from that, it\\'s about working the socks off in training. \"When you don\\'t play cricket, you have only one thing in your hands, hard training. Negative points, lessen the errors, doubled the hard work, focus and mindset but not what happens or not.\"\\n\\nThe results are there to see for Umesh Yadav, even on a pitch which - in his own words - lacked pace. \"We had to hit the deck hard to extract the pace,\" Umesh said. And hit the deck hard he did. His performance in the second Test may not have changed anything. But with chances few and far between, Umesh has made the one in Pune count.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nIndia South Africa tour of India, 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRELATED STORIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarkram ruled out of Ranchi Test with fractured wrist\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKohli two points away from overtaking Smith in Test rankings\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth Africa grapple with experience and consistency void\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia\\'s record-breaking sequence at home\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaharaj ruled out of Ranchi Test with shoulder injury\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecord-breaking India take unassailable 2-0 lead\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarkram ruled out of Ranchi Test with fractured wrist\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJozi Stars sign up Shoaib Malik for MSL 2019\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBangladesh receive Tamim injury scare ahead of India tour\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Ganguly going to be a BCCI president with a difference?\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGus Logie named interim head coach of West Indies women\\'s team\\n\\n6h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill discuss Dhoni\\'s future with selectors - Ganguly\\n\\n7h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

The usual suspects in Andre Russell, Jason Holder and Carlos Brathwaite couldn't fire in all disciplines, while Dwayne Bravo was ruled out injured. There were glimpses of all-round potential in Raymon Reifer and Romario Shepherd but not enough to merit a place. Hence, it was tough to arrive at the ideal balance in both batting depth and bowling. Here's our workaround version.\\n\\nBrandon King (496 runs, Avg - 55.11, S/R - 148.94) - GAW\\n\\nPicked in the ninth round of the CPL draft, 24-year old Brandon King took the tournament by storm, which figuratively materialised to blow the Barbados Tridents away in the first Qualifier. His rapid-fire 132* off 72 balls - the highest individual CPL score ever - brought Guyana coach Johan Botha to tears of joy. Apart from that, King showed tremendous consistency at the top of the order, finishing as the highest run-getter. The kind of tournament he's had, being a largely unknown entity coming in, it won't be any surprise if a national call-up isn't far away.\\n\\nLendl Simmons (430 runs, Avg - 39.09, S/R - 150.34) - TKR\\n\\nThe move to Trinbago Knight Riders worked wonders for Lendl Simmons who gave a reminder of his ability in the shortest format after an underwhelming previous season. The right-hander struck the most number of fifties in the competition with five of them, holding his own even while the Knight Riders had a late slump. His fifty in the Eliminator stabilized a modest run-chase when it could've so easily unravelled under pressure. But unfortunately, that run of consistency was broken in the second Qualifier, blending itself into a defeat for the Knight Riders.\\n\\nGlenn Phillips * (wk) (374 runs, Avg - 37.40, S/R - 144.96) - JT\\n\\nIt was another outstanding tournament for wicketkeeper-batsman Glenn Phillips. His efforts may not have stopped Jamaica Tallawahs from finishing last on the table, but nevertheless, it didn't stop him from getting noticed either. A blistering 87 off just 49 balls against St Kitts and Nevis Patriots was his standout performance, although his team collapsed all around him and still lost comprehensively - a fitting encapsulation of how Phillips stood tall amid the ruins for Jamaica, for whom he opened the innings but will have to make-do with the No. 3 spot here.\\n\\nShoaib Malik * (c) (317 runs, Avg - 63.40, S/R - 124.31) - GAW\\n\\nFree from the responsibilities of international cricket, Shoaib Malik enjoyed his time at the CPL this year. And not just with his captaincy, which presided over an unprecedented 11-match winning streak. But his batting, unlike last season, also flourished, specializing in providing the calmness required in the middle order. While Malik mostly played the role of an anchor to guard against trouble, his quickfire twin fifties against Jamaica Tallawahs showed how he can turn it on as well when required. Also goes without saying that he'll be the captain of this team as well.\\n\\nKieron Pollard (349 runs, Avg - 58,16, S/R - 159.36) - TKR\\n\\nIf being named West Indies captain in limited-overs cricket wasn't special enough, Kieron Pollard was also going to turn out for his home franchise - Trinbago Knight Riders - for the very first time this year. The Knight Riders' late slump in the league stages notwithstanding, Pollard himself had another productive year at the CPL, making his presence felt with impact knocks in the lower middle-order - like the one in the Eliminator where he blitzed 26 off 9 balls to clinch a chase that was getting tricky. But he couldn't do the same in Qualifier 2, where an unfortunate run-out at a crucial juncture damaged his team's chances decisively.\\n\\nFabian Allen (218 runs, Avg - 27.25, S/R - 177.23) - SNP\\n\\nElectrifying in the field, destructive with the bat, Fabian Allen's reputation keeps enhancing with every outing. His 62* off 27 balls against the Jamaica Tallawahs was pure carnage, perfect for the lower middle-order - which when allied with a decent bowling brain and his fielding exploits forms a tempting package.\\n\\nJason Holder (14 wickets at 25.71, Econ - 7.34) - BT\\n\\nYou think Holder and you think about the equable nature that rubs off on his team. His bowling is pretty much the same. Things might be going haywire, until Holder's control triumphs the madness. And so it was this season as well, with the tall medium-pacer keeping things tight for Barbados Tridents while also taking 14 wickets. His leadership saw young players thrive while producing results at the same team, validated by a spot in the finals. One thing that Holder won't be too happy about though would be his returns with the bat, which were quite disruptive - not just to his own team's balance, but to ours as well. However, not compromising on the bowling side - considering the top and middle orders look really formidable - we've settled for the trade-off to pick five genuine bowlers.\\n\\nSunil Narine (7 wickets at 23.14, Econ - 5.78) - TKR\\n\\nIt helps to know what you're going to get in T20 cricket. With Sunil Narine, it's quality. And that doesn't change even with an injured finger. Battling the pain after every ball during the Eliminator, Narine produced a spell of 2/10 in his four overs to help Trinbago Knight Riders progress. He may not have picked a whole bunch of wickets, but an economy rate of less than six is testimony to how batsmen have adopted the play-safe approach. His batting comes in handy too, even if it's not his normal position at the top of the order.\\n\\nImran Tahir * (16 wickets at 12.31, Econ - 5.62) - GAW\\n\\nEven the impending toll of his mandatory celebrations, at the ripe age of 40, doesn't scare Imran Tahir from taking wickets. If anything, he's doubling down. With 15 wickets from 8 matches, at an economy of just 5.58, the leg-spinner was phenomenal for Guyana, playing a major role in their success. Be it with the fielders out, or inside the ring, Tahir excelled. Heck, he even had a wicket-maiden in the powerplay in one of the games against St Lucia Zouks. It's not always that stats tell a complete story of a player's performance, but in his case they come close. Barring one match, Tahir picked up at least two wickets in each of the eight games he played until the final. His worst figures in the tournament were 0/33. What's left to say about him.\\n\\nHayden Walsh Jr. (22 wickets at 12.68, Econ - 8.28) - BT\\n\\nOriginally meant to be just a back-up for Sandeep Lamichhane, USA's Hayden Walsh Jr. surpassed all expectations - of which there were very few. With his variety of leg-breaks and googlies, he bamboozled even high-quality international batsmen - the highlight being a five-for which zapped a TKR run-chase. His inclusion into the team provided a real shot in the arm for the Barbados Tridents in their pursuit of the title.\\n\\nHarry Gurney * (13 wickets at 14.69, Econ - 6.16) - BT\\n\\nUsing a pace bowler as an overseas option is sometimes a risk, but left-armer Harry Gurney pulled his weight and a lot more. Not only did he prove to be a wicket-taking option, but even a disciplined one. He endured one bad game in Qualifier 1, getting thrashed for 0/46, in an otherwise excellent tournament. His variations of pace, and indeed those of length, towards the death overs kept batsmen guessing while reflecting nicely on the experience he's garnered from his various T20 stints across the world.\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nCaribbean Premier League 2019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRELATED STORIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCarter, Nurse star as Barbados Tridents bag second CPL title\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerfect Warriors look to set right an imperfect reputation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll-round Nurse takes Barbados Tridents into CPL final\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrandon King century takes Guyana Amazon Warriors to CPL 2019 final\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNarine, Pollard take Trinbago Knight Riders into Qualifier\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRuthless Amazon Warriors register 10th successive win\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarkram ruled out of Ranchi Test with fractured wrist\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJozi Stars sign up Shoaib Malik for MSL 2019\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBangladesh receive Tamim injury scare ahead of India tour\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Ganguly going to be a BCCI president with a difference?\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGus Logie named interim head coach of West Indies women's team\\n\\n6h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill discuss Dhoni's future with selectors - Ganguly\\n\\n7h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

The nominees against whom objections were raised were given till October 10 to issue a clarification, on the basis of which the final draft roll was released.\\n\\nOne of the key objections raised was over Delhi and District Cricket Association\\'s nominee Rajat Sharma finding his name in the final electoral roll. The objection was with regards to DDCA being in violation of the Lodha recommendations with OPA Sharma, an MLA, serving as the treasurer of the association. The complaints of biased approach further heightened with Manipur Cricket Association\\'s Rajkumar Imo Singh being disqualified from the final electoral roll on grounds of discharging public duty as a Congress MLA.\\n\\nThe bigger issue, however, came with the nominees of BCA, OCA and Uttarakhand finding their names in the final electoral roll even without the respective associations having their constitutions registered, while the likes of Maharashtra Cricket Association, Tamil Nadu Cricket Association and Haryana Cricket Association were disqualified for not being compliant.\\n\\nAnother major concern raised was over the disqualification of the three government associations - Services, Railways and Indian Universities - for not having selected their representative from the players\\' association, which none of them have due to practical difficulties.\\n\\nIn a statement released on Saturday (October 12), Gopalswami said, \"The scope of the Electoral Officer\\'s remit during scrutiny of applications for nomination of Representatives of compliant Full Members was to determine (i) whether the nominee had been properly authorised in accordance with the constitution of the Member Association, as approved by the CoA, and the BCCI constitution and (ii) whether the nominee was eligible to act as a Representative in terms of the constitution of the Member Association, as approved by the CoA, and the BCCI constitution.\"\\n\\nThe electoral officer, in stating his responsibilities, has put the onus of answering these questions on the Committee of Administrators.\\n\\n\"Where the Electoral Officer deemed necessary, the Representative was provided an opportunity to respond in writing or during a personal hearing, to relevant objections to his candidature,\" he added. \"The scrutiny was completed after due consideration of the objections received, responses provided and information relating to the compliance status of Full Members, as provided by the CoA to the Electoral Officer.\"\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarkram ruled out of Ranchi Test with fractured wrist\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJozi Stars sign up Shoaib Malik for MSL 2019\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBangladesh receive Tamim injury scare ahead of India tour\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Ganguly going to be a BCCI president with a difference?\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGus Logie named interim head coach of West Indies women\\'s team\\n\\n6h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill discuss Dhoni\\'s future with selectors - Ganguly\\n\\n7h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

Having injured himself earlier, he aggravated that injury during the first Test against New Zealand at Hamilton on last February when he dived on the field twice. Scans ahead of the World cup revealed that the 33-year-old had suffered a grade 3 tear on his shoulder, forcing him not to bowl in the mega-tournament.\\n\\nHe resumed bowling thereafter, but in short bursts. But although Mahmudullah bowled in the three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka, it hardly looked that he had regained back his full rhythm as he bowled with a round-arm action. He started bowling occasionally with a high-arm action during the just concluded Test series against Afghanistan but bowled only four overs and picked up a wicket.\\n\\nMahmudullah needed some big spells under his belt to get back the confidence as a bowler and the first phase of the National Cricket League, country\\'s traditional first-class competition, provided him that opportunity, where he bowled 39 overs for Dhaka Metro, across two innings, against Chattogram Division.\\n\\nHe also picked up six wickets, which included the prized scalp of Tamim Iqbal on two occasions in the drawn match.\\n\\n\"I could not bowl for seven months because of my shoulder injury, so I tried to bowl some overs in the middle,\" Mahmudullah told reporters after the match at Mirpur on Sunday (October 13). \"I had a good bowling practice as I tried to bowl as many overs as possible because that was my target. My bowling always gives me some added confidence in my batting.\\n\\n\"We were told that we have to play two or three matches and our coach[ Russell Domingo] instructed us that way so everybody was focused and everybody tried their level best.\\n\\n\"We have the India series coming up. It\\'s a big series and every national team player is trying to perform and get a chance in the squad.\"\\n\\nAccording to the Bangladesh team management, the national cricketers began their preparation for the upcoming tour of India by taking part in the NCL and it couldn\\'t have been any better for Mahmudullah, who also scored 63 runs from 134.\\n\\n\"I would have been happier if I could score a hundred,\" he said. \"The bowlers were getting help in day two or even in day three and so I probably scored two or three runs in the opening 30 to 40 odd deliveries as I wanted to stay at wicket and score when my opportunity comes.\"\\n\\nMahmudullah also brushed aside criticisms around nationals players\\' disinterest in playing NCL and said that it is the busy schedule that keeps them from playing the domestic tournament. The senior trio of Tamim Iqbal, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah have played the NCL after a long gap. Tamim and Mahmudullah last played NCL in 2015, when they represented Chattogram and Dhaka divisions respectively while Mushfiqur turned up for Rajshahi Division for a lone game in 2017.\\n\\n\"We had lots of international matches. Everyone was busy too, playing league games. But it\\'s not like we did have available time and we did not want to play,\" said Mahmudullah.\\n\\n\"The thing is that, if we have proper time to rest and opportunities (to play)- we are ready to play because we want to play- does not matter if it\\'s domestic or international matches.\" he said adding the competitiveness of NCL has increased.\\n\\n\"I think, there was a good difference (than earlier). I think everyone is trying harder than before. Whether it\\'s batting or bowling - everyone is working hard. That is the main thing. Sometimes you will perform and sometimes you won\\'t but you have to keep the process active - that is important.\"\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\nMahmudullah\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarkram ruled out of Ranchi Test with fractured wrist\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJozi Stars sign up Shoaib Malik for MSL 2019\\n\\n2h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBangladesh receive Tamim injury scare ahead of India tour\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Ganguly going to be a BCCI president with a difference?\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGus Logie named interim head coach of West Indies women\\'s team\\n\\n6h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill discuss Dhoni\\'s future with selectors - Ganguly\\n\\n7h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

The announcement was made directly by the player through the player's official Twitter account as opposed to a press release by the board, which is the norm.\\n\\nEarlier, Nepal had been reinstated by the ICC as a Full Members, albeit, on a conditional basis, after the election of a Central Working Committee for the Cricket Association of Nepal, consisting of 17 members.\\n\\nNepal was suspended in 2016 on the grounds of breaching the ICC regulations, which included the absence of 'free and fair elections' due to government interference. The nation's conditional reinstatement also opens up avenues for funding, which is certainly a good sign for cricket in Nepal, as a plan for Nepal's full reinstatement gets underway.\\n\\nHowever, the resignation of the Nepalese captain certainly appears to be a regressive move as a part of the bigger picture. Khadka's achievements include leading Nepal to their first-ever ODI series win against the United Arab Emirates earlier this year, contributing handsomely with a hundred, and remains the only Nepalese player to score a T20I hundred (against Singapore in August).\\n\\n© Cricbuzz\\n\\nShare Tweet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATEST NEWS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUAE hit with match-fixing suspensions ahead of T20 Qualifiers\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBopara to leave Essex after 18 years\\n\\n3h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAhsan Ali, Mohammad Hasnain help Sindh secure narrow win\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObjections raised over MPCA selection committees\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYashasvi Jaiswal becomes youngest to register List-A double ton\\n\\n4h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Tremain pens three-year deal with Sydney Thunder\\n\\n16h ago\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore News\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMOBILE SITE & APPS\\n\\nm.cricbuzz.com\\n\\nAndroid\\n\\niOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW US ON\\n\\nfacebook\\n\\ntwitter\\n\\nyoutube\\n\\nPinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPANY\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAdvertise\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\nTerms of Use\\n\\nCricbuzz TV Ads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2019 Cricbuzz.com, Times Internet Limited.

This has created anger in the United camp and when Liverpool’s Kenny Dalglish in turn cursed at Arsene Wenger after the meeting with Arsenal the United Fans acted.\\n\\nAccording to The Mirror Manchester United bombarded FA with the requirement that the Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish also be punished. The appeal rejected by FA that claims “Do not compare with Rooney”.\\n\\nIt was in overtime the drama between the coaches Kenny Dalglish and Arsene Wenger got into an argument. Dalglish swore, against Wenger, an event that was captured by the cameras.\\n\\nFA is now seeing the consequences of their incompetent behavior and hopefully these incidents will just fall back into the shadows and forgetfulness. Because like I stated earlier if FA want’s to suspend every player or manager who curses it will end up in disaster.\\n\\nNow let’s enjoy Tottenham – Arsenal, which is the last chance for Arsenal to come back in the title race after Manchester United’s draw against Newcastle.

The fact is that there is a lot of cursing in the pitch during a soccer game, dosen’t matter if you look at the Italian league or the Spanish league or Bundesliga. Soccer is a emotional sport and to suspend players for cursing would only result in matches where there will be several players not available to play for something stupid as cursing.\\n\\nInstead FA should focus on things that affect the game like crazy tackles, simulation and cheating.\\n\\nAnyways here comes a video clip with Dalgish telling Wenger to “piss off” quite funny actually,\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRyOQURqcns&feature=player_embedded\\n\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOENd_S-Ybc&feature=player_embedded\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Articles:\\n\\nWayne Rooney leads Manchester United to victory\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t18 April, 2011 in socrates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\tWayne Rooney leads Manchester United to victory\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t Page 1 of 11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Reply\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYour email address will not be published.

He ran into Vieira and told him that he was about to take over the English club Arsenal and wondered if Vieira would be eager to test his wings in the Premier League. Ajax had also at that time expressed an interest in Vieira and was probably pretty sure to get the Frenchman’s signature, but Vieira had been persuaded by Arsene Wenger’s and Arsenal was his choice.\\n\\nThis would be the beginning of nine fantastic years he spent in the club. Most already know about his achievements: his three league titles, he won four FA Cups and all the other individual awards – each including five years in a row in the PFA Team of the Year.\\n\\nOutside the pitch, it was a bit trickier: in the beginning of his time in London, he had problems with the language and when Tony Adams gave an emotional speech in the locker room, Vieira had no idea what was going on:\\n\\n“The first big moment was when Tony Adams spoke to the team in the dressing room one day. I was there. I could not understand a Word. I Could feel the emotions but I did not know what was going on. Tony Adams was in the process of confessing to the team that he was an Alcoholic. ”\\n\\nAfter a year, the vocabulary in English became richer and it was also the beginning of a number of other French players arrival at the club – Arsenal began to resemble the family who Vieira played with in Cannes, one in which Vieira felt safe and happy. The family atmosphere lead to the double in the 97/98 season.\\n\\nBecause of his fine season at Arsenal, Vieira was also considered for the 1998 World Cup on home soil, ahead of them in the pecking-order was his new club mate Emmanuel Petit as well as the tactical genius Didier Deschamps. France won this tournament and although Vieira only played a group stage game and the last fifteen minutes in the finals the experience was monumental for his future career.\\n\\nDuring Euro 2000 he was finally a starter. After a rather successful group play for Les Bleus it was time for the quarterfinals, opponents – Spain. After a match that was controlled by France, just barely made it through to the semi finals. Where the team would face Portugal, Portugal was defeated in a dramatic match.\\n\\nWhen David Trezeguet scored the epic goal in the final, it meant that France, in two years, won both World and European championships. Above all, it meant that the country was now a superpower in football thanks to a golden generation of players who loved being with each other both on and off the pitch:\\n\\n“We changed the way that people viewed the blue shirt of France. And that’s, perhaps, is the things that makes me most proud ”\\n\\nBy the time he left Highbury, he was one of the greatest players in the Arsenal’s history.\\n\\nVieira anno 2011 is not exactly the world’s best midfielder, but it reminds me of the good old days when Roy Keane and Vieira was fighting over the ownership as the title of the worlds greatest defensive midfielder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Articles:\\n\\nPatrick Vieira\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t14 April, 2011 in socrates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\tPatrick Vieira\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t Page 1 of 11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Reply\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYour email address will not be published.

But there are players who will have some sort of major importance during the season.\\n\\nThe list, like all the lists are of course entirely subjective and you are absolutely sure your own ideas about which players are worth keeping an eye on during the season.\\n\\n(1) Luis Suarez, Liverpool\\n\\nLuis Suarez is a very witty, technical and goal scoring player, something he proved in Ajax.\\n\\nHe is also a player with a creative eye for the game. He will probably have a very big role in Liverpool’s attacking play.\\n\\nSuarez arrived at Anfield in January and this is his first full season in the club and league. It is now he should step forward. Suarez is a player with the same iconic significance for Anfield hopes as Torres once had.\\n\\n(2) Demba Ba, Newcastle\\n\\nSummer has clearly demonstrated how Newcastle (still) is a club with internal problems. These types of clubs seem to be something that Ba is drawn to. Newcastle for its part, signed him as a replacement for the volatile Andy Carroll.\\n\\n(3) Gabriel Agbonlahor, Aston Villa\\n\\nAgbonlahor is one of several players with a similar playing style that emerged at Villa in recent years. The difference is that he is one of the few remaining in the club. Ashley Young and Stewart Downing left last summer, and before them Gareth Barry and James Milner left. The backbone of a proud Aston Villa team.\\n\\nAgbonlahor has long been regarded as very promising, but perhaps not quite succeeded in taking that final step in his development.\\n\\n(4) Fernando Torres, Chelsea\\n\\nIt’s a strange situation Torres is in. In his best moments, he is undoubtedly one of the planet’s best striker, a very versatile and toxic Striker. Meanwhile, his last two seasons has been so bad that many have begun to question his quality.\\n\\nSo this season is something out of an intersection for both Torres and Chelsea’s offensive.\\n\\n(5) Adel Taarabt, Queens Park Rangers\\n\\nTaarabt was The Championships big magician last season. But the Premier League is a different nut to crack.\\n\\nNeil Warnock has not been lazy when it comes to trying to address this problem. Jay Bothroyd and DJ Campbell have both arrived to the club, good signings both.\\n\\nThe real question is whether Taarabt is able to continue to deliver for QPR in the Premier League, where every element has to go both faster and with greater certainty. If he fails QPR will be in trouble.\\n\\n(6) David De Gea, Man Utd\\n\\nThe task of replacing the world’s best goalkeeper and the goalkeeper who is a living legend in one of the world’s biggest clubs is not easy. And he makes it only as 20 years old in a foreign environment.\\n\\nThe discussion whether he will follow the same path as those before him, Mark Bosnich, Massimo Taibi and Roy Carroll and others have already begun.\\n\\nGoalkeeper position in Man Utd seem even more significant when you consider that the club’s success has largely been concentrated in two periods of Ferguson’s manager career where Van Der Sar and Schemeichel where the goalkeepers. David De Gea has a chance to become a worthy successor to them.\\n\\n(7) Micah Richards, Man City\\n\\nSomehow, it is typical of Richard’s development so far, every step forward is accompanied by a relapse back.\\n\\nRichards has otherwise the potential to grow until the Premier League’s best and most dominant right-back. The quality he possesses in the ground. He is a powerhouse. He is fast. He is heavy and dangerous forward, which is necessary for the wing backs in the modern football, and not least for Man City.\\n\\n(8) John O’Shea, Sunderland\\n\\nO’Shea is not new to the leadership role. He was captain of Manchester United several times during his time there.

Well playing in a club that is under-performing, Downing have done it relativly well if you look at assists and contribution in creating goals for the team.\\n\\nDowning, like many Liverpool players, has suffered from the tendency to judge players based on their transfer fees rather than their accomplishments.\\n\\n(4) Joey Barton, QPR\\n\\nThere are many reasons to question Barton as a person. Purely in terms of character, he feels a little too volatile to be able to perform at football’s highest level, like a loose cannon that can go of at anytime.\\n\\nThere are a couple of football players in the English football history that balanced on the border between genius and insanity. Barton is undoubtedly one of them.\\n\\n(3) Peter Crouch, Stoke\\n\\nThere are many prejudices about Crouch. Because he is so tall many managers have used him as a target player. Ironically, it is perhaps just the opposite, his heading game being mediocre, but his technical ability being one of his strength.\\n\\nYeah, well, okay then, but how good is he? A little funny note is that Crouch is the English striker who in the past 30 years has scored the most goals per minute in the English national team.\\n\\n(2) Aaron Ramsey, Arsenal\\n\\nIt may seem to be a strange paradox in Arsenal fans’ relationship to their players. On the one hand there appears to be a justified pride in the club’s capacity to produce young players, but on the other hand, the patience with these players are very limited.\\n\\nThe impressions Ramsey gives me when I see him on the football field is a player with confidence, a lovely drive with the ball, a good eye for the game, a good controller of the tempo and a leader on the pitch.\\n\\n(1) Michael Carrick, Man Utd\\n\\nI wonder if there is another player who is so good at what he does and still remain unappreciated by team’s supporters. It was when he joined the club in 2006 as Manchester United launched its latest period of dominance in English soccer.\\n\\nSome of it is a matter of personality, he simply lacks the charisma that Roy Keane had. Performence was Carrick has definitely succeeded which can be backed up the statistics of his years at old trafford.\\n\\nRelated Articles:\\n\\nPremier League’s Top 9 Players to Watch During 2011/12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t28 July, 2012 in socrates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPremier League’s Top 9 Players to Watch During 2011/12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t Page 1 of 11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Reply\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYour email address will not be published.

However since the finish of the season we have seen the shock departure of Sir Alex Ferguson from the United hot seat, Joe Mourinho’s return to Stamford Bridge and the sacking of Roberto Mancini at Eastlands, all of which mean things will be very different next season. So what does this mean for those football betting fans gambling on the winners of next season’s title?\\n\\nWell, perhaps surprisingly, the changes at Old Trafford have not seen United lose their position as favorites with the bookmakers – although to be fair there is little between the odds for them and City at many sports betting sites. Ferguson’s replacement, David Moyes, is a fine manager, but he does not have the experience of trophy winning at the top level that either Mourinho or Manuel Pellegrino – who is expected to be the new Manchester City manager – have. United’s defense of their title would seem to hinge on how quickly he finds his feet at the club, and the uncertainty over this and other issues may make some football fans prefer to hold off on their bets and play at an online casino for the moment.\\n\\nIndeed, even if they don’t playing football games like Soccer Safari at casino sites is becoming more popular all the time – especially now that mobile casino apps let you play them wherever you are, using your phone. Soccer Safari is one such game that has really caught on, thanks to the combination a real football theme, with humor that it offers. It features animals like lions, cheetahs, warthogs and buffalo playing each other in their own World Cup, and has great video animation to bring this concept to life.\\n\\nThrow in maximum jackpots of $8000 and you have a great way of getting a fun fix of football and betting on your phone, from one of the mobilecasino.mobi sites that feature the game.\\n\\nRelated Articles:\\n\\nPremier League’s 5 Most Underrated Players\\n\\nFirst Round of Premier League 2011/2012\\n\\n10 Worst Soccer Transfers in Premier League 2010/2011\\n\\nPremier League’s Top 9 Players to Watch During 2011/12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t19 June, 2013 in socrates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPremier League’s 5 Most Underrated Players\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst Round of Premier League 2011/2012\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10 Worst Soccer Transfers in Premier League 2010/2011\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t Page 1 of 11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Reply\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYour email address will not be published.

We will look at American Soccer Player at the three major leagues in Europe, the Italian, Spanish and English.\\n\\nSpain\\n\\nSpain is without doubt one of the best Soccer leagues in the world and their league battles against the English league on wich is really the best. Hard to compare the two in my opinion since Spain has the best team in the world while there is a big drop in quality after the top 2 teams.\\n\\nIn Spain there is only one American Soccer player, and he is considered one of the most talented players ever came out from the U.S.\\n\\nName: Jozy Altidore\\n\\nAge: 21\\n\\nClub: Villareal (On loan to Bursapor)\\n\\nPosition: Striker\\n\\nOpinion: Regarded as a major talent in the U.S. and always there fighting for a spot in the starting lineup for the United States. Seems to me that he is looking for a new club, where he gets playing time and can develope. Right now on loan to Bursapor and is a rotation player in their squad, has played 11 games and made one goal. He may have to take a step down and play at a lower level to both get playing and time and improve.\\n\\nEngland\\n\\nThe English Premier League has plenty of Americans Soccer players.\\n\\nName: Clint Dempsey\\n\\nAge: 28\\n\\nClub: Fulham\\n\\nPosition: Striker / Winger\\n\\nOpinion: Donovan is great, but I would claim Dempsey is the best American Soccer player. A regular in Fulham and a full 12 league goals this season, I wonder if big clubs comes knocking at Craven Cottage doors this summer.\\n\\nName: Eddie Johnson\\n\\nAge: 27\\n\\nClub: Fulham (loan to Preston North End)\\n\\nPosition: Striker\\n\\nOpinion: Do not believe that his places is in the Premier League. He should it to Scotland, believes he fits in well in a team there.\\n\\nName: Brad Friedel\\n\\nAge: 40\\n\\nClub: Aston Villa\\n\\nPosition: Goalkeeper\\n\\nOpinion: A terribly underrated goalie. Most likely this will be his final season, but you never know. Stopped playing for the U.S. national team in 2005, otherwise he would have challenged Howard.\\n\\nName: Brad Guzan\\n\\nAge: 26\\n\\nClub: Aston Villa (on loan to Hull)\\n\\nPosition: Goalkeeper\\n\\nOpinion: Can he fill the shoes after Friedel? I think currently there, he has done a pretty good time in Hull and has not reached the age where the best goalie just yet.\\n\\nName: Marcus Hahnemann\\n\\nAge: 38\\n\\nClub: Wolverhampton\\n\\nPosition: Goalkeeper\\n\\nOpinion: Talk about the U.S. has a lot of great goalies, although Hahnemann right now is not the first choice of the Wolves, for it is the very talented Welshman Hennessey. Possibly it is the last season in Europe.\\n\\nName: Stuart Holden\\n\\nAge: 25\\n\\nClub: Bolton\\n\\nPosition: Midfielder\\n\\nOpinion: Has done a really good season at Bolton, and wonder if he will be taking the next step in his career, after the summer. Was not selected in the starting 11 for the U.S. before this season, but everything else would be a joke now.\\n\\nName: Tim Howard\\n\\nAge: 32\\n\\nClub: Everton\\n\\nPosition: Goalkeeper\\n\\nOpinion: First Goalkeeper in the U.S. and Everton, a underrated goalie in my opinion. He might not be a world class goalie, but definitely a very good goalkeeper.\\n\\nName: Eric Lichaj\\n\\nAge: 22\\n\\nClub: Aston Villa (on loan at Leeds)\\n\\nPosition: Defender\\n\\nOpinion: In a few years or so I think Lichaj will be a starting player in the U.S. national team, has done well in Leeds and will surely fight for a place in the starting 11 of Aston Villa for next season.\\n\\nName: Jonathan Spector\\n\\nAge: 25\\n\\nClub: West Ham\\n\\nPosition: Defender\\n\\nOpinion: His team got relegated from the Premiership this year. Has not been 100% regular this season, nor in the U.S. national team. It will not hurt him to go down to a lower division and get plenty of playing time.\\n\\nName: Zak White Bread\\n\\nAge: 27\\n\\nClub: Norwich\\n\\nPosition: Defender\\n\\nOpinion: Norwich just went up to the the Premier League, but I really wonder if White Bread will hold his place? It is very possible that he does, but one must not forget it’s a big difference between the Championship and Premier League.\\n\\nName: Robbie Findley\\n\\nAge: 25\\n\\nClub: Nottingham Forest\\n\\nPosition: Striker\\n\\nOpinion: Left the MLS at the end of 2010 and his arrival in England could have started better, he was injured almost immediately and missed large parts of the spring season.\\n\\nName: Mike Grella\\n\\nAge: 24\\n\\nClub: Leeds (on loan to Swindon)\\n\\nPosition: Striker\\n\\nOpinion: Grella should try a new club so he gets playing time and perhaps could develop into the talent he was considered at one time.\\n\\nName: Anton Peterlin\\n\\nAge: 24\\n\\nClub: Plymouth Argyle\\n\\nPosition: Midfielder\\n\\nOpinion: Totally unknown in the United States when he last season, signed with Everton from the Ventura County Fusion, but after a rather mediocre season in the reserves Everton chose not to renew his contract. Instead Peterlin moved to Plymouth where he is considered to be a first team player.\\n\\nName: Frank Šimek\\n\\nAge: 26\\n\\nClub: Carlisle United\\n\\nPosition: Defender\\n\\nOpinion: in 2007, he was actually selected to the squad for the U.S team, today he is not even close. Although I have heard and read that he seems to do really well in his current club team.\\n\\nItaly\\n\\nThe Italian league has dropped a lot in recent years and I am not even sure if is better than the German Bundesliga. There is only one American Soccer player in Italy and he is currently on loan at Twente in the Dutch league.\\n\\nName: Oguchi Onyewu\\n\\nAge: 29\\n\\nClub: Milan (on loan at Twente)\\n\\nPosition: Defender\\n\\nOther: Onyewu was king in the World Cup in South Africa and was recruited to Milan, but was loaned out to Twente. His future is uncertain, Onyewu may have to make move to a different club to get some real playing time.\\n\\nI also want to also add an outsider who finally got a chance to join the U.S. squad for the Gold Cup tournament. Alejandro Bedoya is a player I want to add because he is simply a great player. He is currently playing in Sweden for the club Orebro SK. Hopefully he will get some playing time during the tournament and show what kind of player he is. In my opinion he is good enough for the starting 11 of the U.S. national team.\\n\\nRelated Articles:\\n\\n10 Worst Soccer Transfers in Premier League 2010/2011\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t2 June, 2011 in socrates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t10 Worst Soccer Transfers in Premier League 2010/2011\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t Page 1 of 11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Reply\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYour email address will not be published.

The queston who will win the premier league? Is still an open one. Among these big clubs, however Everton have burst into the third place, and close behind them, West Bromwich Albion at fourth place.\\n\\nMost of the talk so far has centered on Everton’s season opening, but West Bromwich is up there, on the same points as Everton.\\n\\nA common opinion about West Brom has been that they were too good for the Championship, but not good enough for the Premier League. In the last 13 seasons, the club has moved up and down seven times, and gone to the playoffs in two more. Now they play for the third consecutive season in the Premier League.\\n\\nWhat is a realistic league position for West Brom? That they would finish at one of the five top spots is probably out of the question, perhaps one of the places between 6-8. It would then mean that West Brom next season could play European Football. Imagine Champions League betting between West Brom and Real Madrid, what would be the odds on that game?\\n\\nThe main reason for the success of West Brom in short, is that is a well-run English club, run by a long-term perspective in mind, without incurring additional costs beyond the club regardless of the results could handle.\\n\\nWest Brom have been defensively more solid this season than last, but also has more offensive options, with players like Shane Long, Peter Odemwingie and Romelu Lukaku available.\\n\\nThe contrast with Aston Villa, one of West Brake main rivals in football in the Midlands, is clear. For while West Brom are on the steady rise, Aston Villa tried spending to catch up with other Champions League rivals, but failed, and the savings package as Randy Lerner then forced the club has led to a greatly weakened squad. Aston Villa won the European Cup in 1982, and has tried to regain a corresponding status more or less ever since.\\n\\nStatus does not transform in a day or a season, it’s a longer process than that, and Aston Villa remains the biggest club in the region. They have the biggest stadium, most fans and a more storied history. But football is played in the present and on the football field, West Brom will be the best club in the Midlands for the foreseeable future.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Articles:\\n\\nFirst Round of Premier League 2011/2012\\n\\nAmerican Soccer Players in Europe\\n\\nTop 10 Premier League Transfers of 2010/2011\\n\\nPremier League’s Top 9 Players to Watch During 2011/12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t15 October, 2012 in socrates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst Round of Premier League 2011/2012\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmerican Soccer Players in Europe\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTop 10 Premier League Transfers of 2010/2011\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t Page 1 of 11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Reply\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYour email address will not be published.

A fantastic first season that promises more. He made an huge impact, already this year. Undoubtedly, a player with many years ahead. Like the players that Man Utd needed. Quite simply the perfect transfer.\\n\\n(2), Ben Foster, Birmingham – £ 6m\\n\\nProbably the perfect goalkeeper for a team fighting relegation in the Premier League. Relatively inexpensive, Foster has saved countless of points for Birmingham in the league and with his match-winning effort at Wembley, he secured both the League Cup and European cup games to Birmingham.\\n\\n(3), Yaya Toure, Man City – £ 24m\\n\\nNot just any budget acquisition, but on the other side Man City has its own economic logic. The great player has grown up to be Man City’s special big game-player, a perfect link in midfield. Significant in the league but even more clearly, it was Toure who shot the FA Cup to Man City.\\n\\n(4) DJ Campbell, Blackpool – £ 1.5 m\\n\\nWas on loan at Blackpool last season and was instrumental in their promotion campaign. Bought permanently this year, Campbell has continued to make important goal for Blackpool, not least in the match against Bolton. Impressive for a new striker in the Premiership.\\n\\n(5) David Silva, Man City – £ 25m\\n\\nSilva has quickly put to shame the question that existed as to whether he could play in the Premiership. A major link-up player from Man City’s defensive and offensive line.\\n\\n(6), Raul Meireles, Liverpool – £ 11.5 m\\n\\nHas been good in the worst of times, and has been fantastic in the best of times. A really solid transfer to a more than reasonable price. Had problems initially where he often played out of position, but has grown to be an anchor in Liverpool’s midfield and key in the team’s shape-up in the spring.\\n\\n(7) Peter Odemwingie, West Brom – £ 0.5m\\n\\nA quick, witty and technical striker who won many points for West Brom and probably been the difference between the -West Brom and this season’s more stable West Brom who saved new contract with a number of matches remaining. A real bargain as well.\\n\\n(8) Rafael van der Vaart, Tottenham – £ 8m\\n\\nThe big coup at the transfer deadline day. Managed to inspire Spurs to new heights during the season’s first half and there was talk of him as a form of Cantona transfer. But unlike Cantona the Dutchman fell slightly away from the high level when the season entered its decisive phase.\\n\\n(9) Adel Taarabt, Queens Park Rangers – £ 1m\\n\\nWould you rank the transfers completely in economic value for the club, this is probably England’s best. He was behind QPR’s league winning promotion push in the Championship, and The Hoops are back in the Premier League.\\n\\n(10), Titus Bramble, Sunderland – £ 1m\\n\\nTitus Bramble has for me always been seen as a shaky defender. Not so this season where he has been one of Sunderland defensive rocks. The old man Steve Bruce saw something in Bramble as the rest of us mortals, was simply blind to.\\n\\nOutsiders:\\n\\nLuis Suarez, Liverpool – £ 23m\\n\\nChris Smalling, Man Utd – £ 10m\\n\\nIshmael Tioté, Newcastle – £ 3.5m\\n\\nJonathan Walters, Stoke – £ 2.75m\\n\\nStephen Hunt, Wolves – £ 3m\\n\\nWhat do you think?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Articles:\\n\\nTop 5 of Jimmy Bullard\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t24 May, 2011 in socrates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\tTop 5 of Jimmy Bullard\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t Page 1 of 11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Reply\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYour email address will not be published.

The players battled heroically but the match was already over when Crouch decided to leave his brain in the locker room prior the game. Two headers later and Adebayor had nailed down the coffin with the Tottenham team still in it desperately trying find a way out.\\n\\nThere is something very distasteful about the current Real Madrid team, I dont know if it is Mourinhos arrogance, Ronaldo being Ronaldo or Carvahlo complaining about everything and anything. Or maybe it is a mixture of all these factors that makes me strongly dislike today’s Real Madrid. Or maybe I am just a nostalgic guy, that misses the old Real Madrid days with Guti, Raul, Zidane and Co.\\n\\nHowever tonight I sympathize with Tottenham and their fans who never really got a chance to show us what they can do in a big night like this.\\n\\nReal Madrid can now start focusing on their three front war against their archenemy Barcelona, who they will most probably play in the Champ League Semis and who they also face in the Spanish League Cup Final.\\n\\nGood luck Mourinho.\\n\\nOn another note Inter-Schalke 2-5 ??

But the celebration came to a halt.\\n\\nWith 15 minutes remaining in the qualifying match against Senegal, Didier Drogba’s scored the second goal on a penalty.\\n\\nIvory Coast had the match at 2-0 and 6-2 overall. That’s when the unrest broke out at the Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium. Several people where hit by projectile thrown in, Senegalese fans began to set fire to the stands and according to AFP throwing bottles, stones and chairs against the players.\\n\\nAround 300 supporters from Ivory Coast was evacuated from the stands and gathered on the field for their safety. Police used tear gas to calm the chaos, but after 40 minutes it was decided that the match would be stopped. According to Senegal’s official news agency, it will not be resumed.\\n\\nA match delegate reportedly hit by a projectile, but no damage should have been reported.\\n\\nIt’s interesting to see how the clubs react to these kind of situations, it’s easy to forget the players are million dollar investments for the clubs.

The game winning goal was Ameobi’s 15ht European goal and came after Metalist goalkeeper Olexandr Goryainov tripped up Moussa Sissoko.\\n\\nAmeobi’s goal was not the only highlight of the game. Late in the game Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Kruel had to make an improbably double save in order to keep Jonathan Cristaldo from scoring with just 13 minutes left to play.\\n\\nThe stats for this game were very lopsided in favor of Metalist in all but one telling category. They led in time of possession, shots, more than doubled Newcastle in shots on goals, and even had fewer fouls. However, the stat that is the most telling regarding the outcome is in saves. Newcastle led in this all important category 9-5, including the late saves by Kruel against Cristaldo.\\n\\nNewcastle’s deep run in the Europa League is definitely a morale booster for a squad who has been dwelling in the cellar of the Premier League. A Europa League title could also help the team secure new sponsors. A recent trend has seen several major companies sign EPL sponsorship deals, including online gaming giant Bwin’s signing with Manchester United. A Europa League trophy would show sponsors that the team is indeed competitive and has just had a bad string of luck in the Premier League this year.\\n\\nShola Ameobi’s goal at the 64th minute easily allowed Newcastle to move on to the round of 16 in the Europa league. The team needed only a draw or lose in extra time to move on. Their victory ensures they will move on as they now wait to find out whether they will face Anzhi Makhachkala or Hannover.\\n\\nRelated Articles:\\n\\nFirst Round of Premier League 2011/2012\\n\\nPremier League’s Top 9 Players to Watch During 2011/12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t26 February, 2013 in Guest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPremier League’s Top 9 Players to Watch During 2011/12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst Round of Premier League 2011/2012\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t Page 1 of 11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Reply\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYour email address will not be published.

You can look at the French national team how fast a glorified and homogenous team can be demolished.\\n\\nThe core of the players in the Spanish national team will have passed its peak after European Championship in 2012 and after that generation the pressure is going to be tremendous on the next. Players like Xavi, Iniesta, Villa, Puyol, Capedvile, will not be at the same level for the campaign for the 2014 World Cup campaign.\\n\\nThe positive factor for Spanish soccer is that there already is a new generation of leaders ready to take over, players like Fabregas, Pedro, Busquets all have the qualities to be the core of a squad that are contenders for the World Cup title, however this new generation will have to tackle a complete different type of pressure when entering a campaign, the expection that they should win the World Cup.\\n\\nThis is a heavy weight to carry on your shoulder which players from France, Brazil, Italy and believe it or not England have to experience every championship the national team is involved in. The current Spanish national team did not really have this pressure when they played the Euro Championship in 2008 or the World Cup in 2010, even though quality wise they had the players to be real contenders.\\n\\nIt is easy to forgot that Spain does not have a tradition of a good national team and it is only the later years they have started winning championships. So can the new generation handle the heat that awaits team? Only time will tell.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo related posts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t3 March, 2011 in socrates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRevolution at Manchester United\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTop 30 Highest Paid Football Managers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGroundhog Day Mathieu Flamini Comes Back\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t Page 1 of 11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Reply\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYour email address will not be published.

Oh my god. How is this man designed? What is he made of? What does he eat? I want to know, for he can not be a mortal man.\\n\\nAdd Rooney performance this weekend where he got England to take the spin and forgive for all the latest negative press.\\n\\nAnd only by looking back a year in Wayne’s World you will see how really questionable his career was. Bad performances, contract dispute, World Cup embarrassment, public infidelity and dumped advertising contracts, newly toddler’s dad, hated by all the fans in England and much more. Rooney has gone trough a lot of what Fernando Torres has gone trough when it comes to the problems in the pitch, the only difference is that Rooneys problems have been a lot more problematic. So while Torres is still looking like an old shadow of him Rooney has digged himself up from his hole and showed the world that this boy is a bit special.\\n\\nIt is clear that his form has been on the rise,\\n\\nregardless, it was a dazzling first half Rooney did. He drove like a fury over the pitch and crowned the day by submitting the1-0 goal. Even in the second half, he was strong and led his United to victory\\n\\nThe game is far from over, when we look forward to the return at Old Trafford.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Articles:\\n\\nThe Battle of Britain – Chelsea VS.

As Mr.Wenger seems to get more cranky for each season, Kenny had enough and told him to “piss off”. Now the question is if FA will suspend Kenny for his choice of language as they did with the Rooney incident.\\n\\nFA has truly shot themselves in this matter. The fact is that there is a lot of cursing in the pitch during a soccer game, dosen’t matter if you look at the Italian league or the Spanish league or Bundesliga. Soccer is a emotional sport and to suspend players for cursing would only result in matches where there will be several players not available to play for something stupid as cursing.\\n\\nInstead FA should focus on things that affect the game like crazy tackles, simulation and cheating.\\n\\nAnyways here comes a video clip with Dalgish telling Wenger to “piss off” quite funny actually,\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRyOQURqcns&feature=player_embedded\\n\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOENd_S-Ybc&feature=player_embedded\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Articles:\\n\\nWayne Rooney leads Manchester United to victory\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t18 April, 2011 in socrates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\tWayne Rooney leads Manchester United to victory\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t Page 1 of 11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Reply\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYour email address will not be published.

Obviously terrible news for Abidal and his family. As Eric Abidal is entering this though time the French national team is starting their own journey with a new head coach Laurent Blanc.\\n\\n“I know that the disease is chronic. I know there is a risk that I will get it again. But then … you have no idea how much I’ve learned by going through this. My brain has never been stronger.I wish I had always been so great to enjoy the little things in life. Just that you being around friends today, what fun it is! Not to do too much planning without living in the moment. I really do know now. And then it’s hell to get something like this to get that insight. “\\n\\nThe thing is that Abidal already seems to be the type of person who offers himself, setting up happily in interviews and always seems to be in good spirits. It feels as if no referee has ever awarded an incorrect yellow card for him and many others got away with three.\\n\\nXavi said about Abidal, “This is the toughest time I’ve had at the club, but Abidal will fight his way through it mentally, he is one of the strongest people I know.\\n\\nThese are tough times for both Abidal and his family. He is a role model for everybody and is always positive. He said ‘that’s life, and that we must continue as we do and win against Getafe on Saturday’. We will do everything we can to win the match and dedicate it to Abi and his family. ”\\n\\nWhen France took the World Cup gold in 1998, it is well more than likely that a young Eric Abidal was one of those who celebrated in the streets. The French victory was special – not just because it was their first World Cup gold medal – but because the multi-ethnic team had been attacked during the tournament of the Front National leader Jean-Marie Le Pen. Le Pen said that the team did not look “enough French.” And it’s wrong to say that everyone else did not agree with his statement.\\n\\nIt’s not impossible to believe that a then 18-year-old Abidal (with roots in Martinique) identified himself a lot with the new French national team that had roots from different parts of the world. When he became part of the squad he had also become part of the debate, both because of his background, but also because he converted to Islam.\\n\\n“It’s a touchy subject in France, and for me as I believe in openness and tolerance to 100% for all religions and beliefs, as long as they respect others. I think some French and Westerners may have a distorted image of Islam for obvious reasons. Islam has no power in French society, which may be the case with the Catholic Church. There is only one faith, so when someone tries to insinuate that Islam is an underlying threat to anything, so it is unacceptable.”\\n\\nWhen it comes to Abidal and his role in the French national squad, he was one of the most valued players. Fact tells you that he played in the most competitive matches. Many times, his status was questioned, and many wondered how he could keep Evra from the starting line-up for so long.\\n\\nSo what about the chaos that involved the French national team during the last World Cup? Abidal himself have said that the group had shown solidarity for Nicolas Anelka, but in doing so had acted clumsy and immediately set a bad example of how one representing your country should behave. The always so witty Eric Cantona have said,\\n\\n” It is good that they got home now. If they stayed for another week, they had eaten each other. At least we avoided cannibalism… “However it is easy to forget that Eric Cantona has achieved zero as a player for the French National team.\\n\\nSadly, the National Front saw a chance to profit from Les Bleus, chaos, and reopened the debate about the French identity. Nowadays this debate is still going on in France, what is French and what is not. But this time the country has a real leader in Laurent Blanc and I predict that the French National team once again will be a power force to recon with in European soccer. Meanwhile Abidal is fighting his way trough an illness and we hope we will see him once again involved in our great sport.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo related posts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t29 March, 2011 in socrates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRevolution at Manchester United\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTop 30 Highest Paid Football Managers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGroundhog Day Mathieu Flamini Comes Back\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPost navigation\\n\\n\\n\\t \\t\\t Page 1 of 11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Reply\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYour email address will not be published.

It is also a very exciting night for soccer fans all over the world when the two undoubtedly best teams in the world this year face each other in the final of the biggest sports tournament of the world.\\n\\nWembley is a special place for both Barcelona and Man Utd who meet tomorrow evening’s finals of the Champions League.\\n\\nNot only was it there both clubs won their first titles in the European Cup – Man Utd 1968 and Barcelona 1992. It is also the stadium where both clubs dealt with their own ghosts and history.\\n\\nFor Manchester United it was their first European title and only 10 years after Munich plane crash. Against Benfica at Wembley, Man Utd with- Best, Law and Charlton Manchester United won for their fallen team mates.\\n\\nFor Barcelona, it was one of the first steps out of Real Madrid’s enormous shadow. It was also the start of the start of the modern Barcelona and the football philosophy we see the fruits of today.\\n\\nTomorrow both clubs return to Wembley and creating new history.\\n\\nMan Utd are in it for them a rather unusual position to go into a game as the underdogs – Barcelona on the other enters as the clear favorites.\\n\\nThis probably fits United very well, and like stated earlier Manchester United’s strengths (counter attacks) is Barcelona’s weakness and Sir Alex Ferguson is very well aware of that.\\n\\nInter managed to beat Barcelona at the San Siro in the least year final, and the Barcelona squad with Pep Guardiola definitively are looking for revenge of their mediocre performance in the last years exit match.\\n\\nThe key factors in this final will be to be compact defensively and hope for a brilliant individual performance of an attacking player. The match within the match will be between Xavi , Iniesta , Messi against Giggs , Park ,Rooney.\\n\\nWho is going to be the game decider you ask?

       " ['A Foot Soldier of Tennis Gets Lucky\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 29, 2019\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bad luck of Wednesday�s spectators made for good luck for their successors on Thursday. Almost everything had been rained out on Wednesday, so there was a great deal of action as the tournament got caught up.\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon arrival at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, I checked out the photo tribute marking the golden anniversary of Rod Laver�s second Grand Slam and the new statue of Althea Gibson before hustling to Court 5 to get one of the last seats in the shade behind the court for the continuation of the match between Christian Garín and Alex de Minaur, which had barely begun on Wednesday before being washed out. (You can see the Laver photos here and the Gibson statue here. Italicized hyperlinks appearing later in this dispatch refer to photographs.)\\n\\n\\n\\nMy day, however, began with a meditation on responsibility. As I waited on the subway platform in Manhattan, I saw a sign explaining why an escalator was not working. New York City Transit wishes to inform the riding public that the escalator, which is out of service for �extensive repairs,� is �privately owned.� Why should a subway rider care who owns the escalator? It is an integral part of a subway station. New York City Transit is responsible for providing accessible transportation, regardless of whether aspects of its operations have been privatized. Since when can a contractor excuse failure to perform by lamenting that its subcontractors are incompetent?\\n\\n\\n\\nCourt 5 featured a Canadian contingent, though I am not sure why, as the players were from Chile and Australia. There were also vocal fans from the home countries of each player, with the Australians chanting the familiar �Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi,� and five of the Chileans wearing shirts spelling out their man�s name.\\n\\n\\n\\nGarín, having won Houston and Munich this year, obviously likes clay courts, and this showed on some of his forays to the net, where he often missed volleys that a decent high school player should make. De Minaur is slightly built but sturdy. He stands near the baseline to return serve and digs for every ball, which enabled him to keep rallies going when it looked like the point was lost, reaping the rewards of persistence when Garín struggled at the net.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn his second break opportunity of the set, de Minaur grabbed a 4-2 lead. He fended off a break point when serving at 5-3, sealing the set with an ace on his third set point.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the second set, de Minaur had four break points in Garín�s first two service games and also had to save one in his first service game. There were no breaks, however, until the eleventh game, when Garín lost four straight points after leading 30-0. When de Minaur served for the set, he hit a deft lob volley at 40-30, giving himself a chance to clinch the set with an easy overhead � which he hit into the net. On the next set point, Garín, stretched, hit an uncharacteristic one-handed backhand passing shot, which sufficed to draw an error from de Minaur. Garín canceled a third set point with a winning backhand return off a slow second serve from de Minaur. On the fourth, however, Garín dropped a routine backhand into the net, and the Australian had a commanding lead.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe third set was almost an afterthought. De Minaur raced to a 4-0 lead and even had a break point for 5-0. There was a hiccup when he was broken at 5-2, but he broke right back in the ensuing game to close out the match, 6-3 7-5 6-3. The stat sheet showed that de Minaur won 68% of his points at net (19 of 28), while Garín, surprisingly, came to net more often � 40 times � albeit with less success, winning only 23, or 58%, of those points. Garín is a quality player, but on this day de Minaur, still only 20, had a lot more to offer.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile this was going on, I saw snippets of the action on Court 4, where Karolína Muchová, a young Czech who likes to come to net, upset the crafty Su-Wei Hsieh, taking the match in a final-set tiebreak before the players exchanged a warm hug at the net.\\n\\n\\n\\nI trooped to the Grandstand, where Daniil Medvedev was leading Hugo Dellien 5-2 in the first set and stayed long enough to see the Russian open up a 6-3 7-5 lead. After I left, Dellien surprisingly took the third set, 7-5, but Medvedev closed out the match in four, 6-3.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe match seemed plagued by a strange lassitude, perhaps because the fans congregated in the shade, at some remove from the court, and Dellien was unable to threaten Medvedev, at least while I was present. It seems possible, however, that the longueurs were attributable in part to Medvedev�s style of play. He stands very far back to receive serve, often rallies from deep behind the baseline, and doesn�t do anything that makes you feel like you�re watching a top-five player. Of course, one could respond that Novak Djokovic has won sixteen major titles without offering much flair.\\n\\n\\n\\nDellien � who, earlier this year, became the first Bolivian player in 35 years to win a match on the ATP tour � was game, but he just didn�t have the weapons to stay with Medvedev. Indeed, many of his first serves were under 100 mph. In the second set, Medvedev briefly fell behind by a break at 4-3. He threw his racquet, drawing a warning from the chair umpire, and promptly broke back as he plodded his way toward victory.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy next stop was Court 4, where two lefties were in the third set. Judy Murray�s third-favorite player (or perhaps her first), Feliciano López, was facing Yoshihito Nishioka. Nishioka, who prepares to return serve with a stance similar to Kei Nishikori�s, had taken the first set in a tiebreak, 9-7, saving seven set points along the way, and then López evened the match by serving up a bagel. That Nishioka has a career at all is praiseworthy: he is listed at 5�7� (1.70 m) (which may be generous), and he suffered a ruptured ACL in 2017.\\n\\n\\n\\nLópez, at 37, is still able to attack effectively with a big serve and good feel at the net. His one-handed backhand is not cut out for topspin, so he keeps the ball low with slice and looks for opportunities to move forward. Standing behind the bleachers aside the court, I watched one set before seeking a seat elsewhere. López came back from 0-2 in the third set to get even in the set. At 3-3, he had four break chances, which he could not cash in, but he broke at love in the ninth game and saved a break point in the tenth on his way to capturing the set, 6-4. The final score in López�s favor was 6-7(7) 6-0 6-4 6-4, and he enjoyed big margins over Nishioka on both first-serve and second-serve points won: 86% to 57% and 63% to 51%, respectively. That the match was not a rout is attributable to Nishioka�s making 64% of his first serve, while López connected on only 47%. To give you an idea how effective López�s serve is, he made 50 first serves (on 107 service points) and served 28 aces.\\n\\n\\n\\nI tried to get onto Court 10 for the young American Jenson Brooksby against Nikoloz Basilashvili, but I couldn�t get in. Brooksby had won the first set, and then Basilashvili took close second and third sets before closing the match out 6-2 in the fourth.\\n\\n\\n\\nI snagged a seat on Court 14, where Paolo Lorenzi, who will be 38 in December, was facing Miomir Kecmanovic, who will turn 20 on Saturday. Kecmanovic, who looks somewhat older than his years, has just cracked the top fifty. Lorenzi, who fell to Jirí Veselý in the final round of qualifying and got into the tournament through the back door as a lucky loser, looks every one of his 37 years, with bags under his eyes and a scruffy beard suggesting he�s spent time in a war zone seeing things that you don�t want to know about. (Ironically, it was Kevin Anderson�s withdrawal from the tournament that opened the slot for Lorenzi. In 2017, Lorenzi�s deepest run in a major ended in the fourth round of the US Open, when he was eliminated by Anderson in a match covered on this blog.)\\n\\n\\n\\nLorenzi is a loud grunter, whereas Kecmanovic lets out puffs of air as he strikes the ball. The quieter Kecmanovic was more likely to show his frustrations, however, muttering in Serbian either to himself or to his supporters in the stands. Lorenzi�s four finals on the ATP Tour have all come on clay, which might explain why the brace on his right ankle had a red tinge.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I arrived, Lorenzi was leading by two sets to one, all three sets having gone to tiebreaks. Lorenzi had taken the first tiebreak 13-11, saving five set points along the way. Lorenzi had served for the second set and lost two set points before being broken and finally dropping the set. The third set had been somewhat less topsy-turvy: Lorenzi had been up a break, Kecmanovic had gotten even, and then Lorenzi won the tiebreak easily.\\n\\n\\n\\nShortly after I arrived, Kecmanovic broke serve with a backhand down the line, roaring in self-approval as he took a 3-1 lead in the fourth. Lorenzi broke back with a forehand drop volley, but dropped serve in the eighth game. When Kecmanovic served for the fourth set, Lorenzi had two break points, but the youngster held on and sent the match to a deciding set.\\n\\n\\n\\nLorenzi nosed ahead in the fifth set when he won a long fourth game after Kecmanovic had taken a 40-15 lead. In the next game, Kecmanovic cancelled the veteran�s lead, finishing off a break from 30-30 with an inside-out forehand winner and an overhead. Lorenzi, the crowd passionately urging him on, reclaimed the edge when he capitalized on his third break point in the sixth game. From there, he closed out the match with a firm hand, holding to 15 for 5-2 and to love for the win, 7-6(11) 6-7(2) 7-6(2) 3-6 6-3.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy next stop, briefly, was Court 5, where I realized I could not get in to see Denis Shapovalov face Henri Laaksonen. I retreated to the Grandstand for the conclusion of Jelena Ostapenko�s 6-4 6-3 victory over the newlywed Alison Riske (whose husband is Stephen Amritraj). Ostapenko, who can be great (2017 Roland Garros champion) or terrible, served up 17 double faults in 92 service points on her way to victory over the American. She broke serve for 5-3 in the second set with a lucky net cord and, in a match that featured 17 breaks of serve, served out the final game at 15.\\n\\n\\n\\nI stayed in the Grandstand to watch Nick Kyrgios toy with the French wild card Antoine Hoang, who has cracked the top 100 but has only one match win on the ATP tour. Before the match began, the songs on the public address system included Prince�s Let�s Go Crazy, perhaps in anticipation of what Kyrgios can do � but it didn�t go that way. At most, toward the end of the match, there was an episode of Let�s Get Mildly Perturbed, but we�ll get to that later.\\n\\n\\n\\nHoang was never going to threaten Kyrgios unless the Australian went way off the beam, which he did not do. With his live arm, Kyrgios served up 24 aces and only one double fault. It�s not just that he hits his serve hard; he also places it accurately near the lines on either side of the box. His toss takes him well inside the baseline, so the ball comes upon the returner with even less time to react.\\n\\n\\n\\nKyrgios broke serve in the opening game and then took care of business on his serve, though he could not resist doing things like hitting a ball behind his back (unnecessarily) in Hoang�s second service game.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second set featured more of the same, as Kyrgios registered two breaks while not facing any break points himself. He felt even less need to constrain himself: when Hoang served at 1-5, Kyrgios hit a slapshot forehand way long and then threatened a SABR (or perhaps, more accurately, SABN?) on Hoang�s first serve (which was a fault).\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the third set, the fun and games led to Hoang�s breaking Kyrgios�s serve twice. Unfortunately for the Frenchman, it was not all prosperity: he dropped his first three service games. Kyrgios had two points for a fourth break � and the match � when Hoang served at 3-5. After Hoang held on, Kyrgios served for the match at 5-4, opening with two aces, falling to 30-30 when he missed a forehand and witnessed Hoang pull off a lunging forehand pass, but then capturing the last two points, closing the proceedings with a service winner clocked at 131 mph.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for the Let�s Get Mildly Perturbed Moment, that came when Kyrgios served at 4-3 40-15. He seemed to close out the game with a big serve, but Hoang�s challenge to the call was upheld. Kyrgios complained, with some justification, that Hoang waited too long to challenge, after the umpire had called the score. The storm clouds blew over, however, when Kyrgios quickly held serve.\\n\\n\\n\\nI closed out my day with a little bit of mixed doubles on Court 5, as the top-seeded team of Michael Venus and Hao-Ching Chan faced Ken Skupski and Andreja Klepac. When I arrived, the favorites had one the first set in a tiebreak and were tied at 2-2 in the second set. With Skupski serving at 2-3, Chan hit a winning lob to get to break point and Venus finished off the game with an overhead. Chan served at 4-2 and found herself at deuce. As mixed doubles is played at the US Open � and as all doubles are played on the regular tour, with the no-ad scoring system � deuce is also a deciding point. In mixed doubles, that means that a man serves to a man and a woman to a woman. Chan served to Klepac, who nailed a hard return that Chan could not handle, and the teams were back on serve. At 4-4, a Venus double fault put him down 30-40, i.e., two break points, but he got out of the jam with a forehand winner and a service winner. Chan was broken at 30 in the 5-5 game, which gave Klepac a chance to serve for the set, but she was broken in turn at 30 to send the set to a tiebreak.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this juncture, Skupski and Klepac had to win the ordinary 12-point tiebreak to qualify for a match tiebreak to decide the match in lieu of a third set. Serving at 4-5, Skupski left a volley hanging, and Venus put it away up the middle. Skupski saved the first match point on his ensuing service point, but then Chan served at 6-5 to close it out. The chair umpire called Skupski�s return long and Klepac registered a challenge. The video review showed the ball was indeed out, so Chan and Venus had won, 7-6(4) 7-6(5).\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stakes are lower in doubles, even more so in mixed doubles, and no-ad scoring makes for more random results, so it�s hard to predict what will happen from here. Chan and Venus hardly seemed dominant, but their opponents were both good doubles players. Don�t be shocked if an unseeded team wins the mixed.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy second day at the Open concluded at a relatively early 9:07 p.m., and I headed to the subway, hoping all the escalators were in good working order.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['Messy Teenager versus Responsible Adult\\n\\nSeptember 2, 2013\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI had a ticket for the night session on Labor Day. My inclination is always to avoid Ashe, though that’s trickier with a night session ticket, especially during the second week, as the day session can wind down not long after sunset. Fortunately for me if not for the holders of day tickets, Monday’s program was substantially delayed by rain. When I got through security – which didn’t start moving till about 6:10, later than usual for the night session – I was able to catch the start of the day session match between Richard Gasquet and Milos Raonic on Court 17.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI returned to the area of Court 17 I had discovered and liked on Sunday. To get there, you must walk under the stands to the side that is furthest from Ashe, and then you have a pretty good chance at a box seat near the baseline or service line. The seat has a decent back and there is more legroom than in the bigger stadiums. You’re also on the side of the court opposite the umpire’s chair, so you have an unobstructed view. (See photo for the view of Ashe from the far side of Court 17; for a full complement of photos, including some not linked below, click here.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother virtue of being on Court 17 was missing Roger Federer’s loss on Armstrong to Tommy Robredo. On Federer’s sad decline, I am akin to the sportswriter Bill Simmons on Godfather III: don’t watch it, and make believe it never happened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGasquet came into this fourth-round match with two negatives: he had lost his only meeting with Raonic, last year in Cincinnati, and he had a record of 1-15 in the fourth round of major tournaments. (Click here for the grim details.) He also came in with some of the distinctive habits I had noticed before, and one I had not. Gasquet daintily bounces the ball before serving with an open palm. When he wins a point on serve, he makes sure to retrieve the lucky ball for use on the next point. In another quirk, which was new to me, he often tapped his racquet three times around the junction of the sideline and baseline when he prepared to receive serve. This one happened irregularly, however, and I was unable to break the code of when the tapping would take place. Of course, the most important aspect of Gasquet’s game is not a quirk, but a beautiful one-handed backhand that he uses to great effect both on the attack and the defensive. (See photos here and here.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for Raonic’s odd habits, we can list knocking the stuffing out of the ball with serves that exceed 140 mph (see photo) – and, well, that’s it. In fact, Raonic was so orderly that he kept the area near his chair tidy throughout what would prove to be quite a long and well-played match, while Gasquet was constantly dropping detritus near his chair, leading a wag to compare his domain to a teenager’s bedroom. (See photo of the two seating areas, Gasquet’s on the left and Raonic’s on the right.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe match began in unlikely fashion, with four breaks of serve in the opening set. The last came when Raonic served for the set at 5-4 and, from deuce, double-faulted twice. Gasquet was hardly out of the woods, needing to save three breaks points at 5-5. In the tiebreak, Raonic established leads of 4-0 and 5-1 and held on to prevail, 7-4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the second set, Gasquet saved two break points in his first service game, and then the players chugged into another tiebreak. The key point came with Raonic serving at 4-4, when he missed a forehand passing shot. Gasquet cashed in his two service points to close out the set, 7-4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe third set was a rout. Raonic broke Gasquet’s serve twice, while dropping only one of 17 points on his own serve. Gasquet’s prospects weakened further in the fourth set, when he went down a break in the fifth game. He immediately broke back, however, and the players stayed on serve thereafter, though Gasquet experienced a 15-40 scare in the eleventh game. With Raonic serving at 5-5 in the tiebreak, Gasquet executed a chip-and-charge – both players came to net effectively and judiciously throughout the match – followed by a lunging forehand volley winner to set up set point on his serve. Raonic saved the set point when Gasquet missed a forehand pass. Raonic reached match point, at 8-7, with a drop volley. Gasquet served the critical point and stayed alive when Raonic’s backhand pass landed just long. After a change of ends at 9-9, Raonic double-faulted, and Gasquet cashed in on his serve when Raonic dumped a forehand into the net.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe final set took 73 minutes and was as hard-fought as its length implies. In the opening game, Raonic saved two break points. Gasquet needed to save three when his turn came. Gasquet broke in the third game and was broken right back in the fourth. Raonic then saved four break points to go ahead, 3-2. On his next turn to serve, Raonic saved three break points and took a 4-3 lead. Gasquet faced his own break point crisis before holding for 4-4. The dam suddenly burst when Raonic served at 5-5. Gasquet snaffled up eight of the next nine points, breaking at love and holding at 15 to capture the match and a trip to the quarterfinals. (See photo of Gasquet raising his arms in triumph and another of the players shaking hands.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe final tally for Gasquet was 6-7(4) 7-6(4) 2-6 7-6(9) 7-5. He had won only 195 points to Raonic’s 207, and dropped serve six times to Raonic’s five. Still, who breaks Raonic an average of once per set? More important, Gasquet withstood Raonic’s power long enough to stay in the match and give himself a chance when the younger man flagged in the fifth set. Only three of Raonic’s 39 aces came in the decisive set, and he averaged 124 and 94 mph on first and second serves, as opposed to 128 and 98 for the match.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext up for Gasquet is a rematch of his fourth-round loss of last year, to David Ferrer, who’s as different from Raonic as sour cream from sauerkraut. The guess here is that Ferrer, devoid of firepower though he may be, will prove too steady for the Frenchman. More important, maybe a spectator at the match will figure out when Gasquet does his racquet-tapping before receiving serve.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['Only Three Matches?\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 27, 2019\\n\\n\\n\\nMy contingent camped out early in Armstrong to get good seats behind the court and in the shade for the match between Stefanos Tsitsipas, the eighth seed, and his contemporary Andrey Rublev. Tsitsipas (italicized hyperlinks refer to photographs), followed by Coco Gauff and Simona Halep as well as a large contingent of local juniors, practiced on the court before play began at 11:00 o’clock.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed was that Armstrong appears to have ditched the ceiling fans that last year hung on the underside of the roof. Last year, the fans were pitched as part of the new stadium’s natural ventilation program. It is hard to tell how much good the fans did, as last year’s Open was played in blast furnace conditions, whereas the temperature barely cracked 70° (or 21° Celsius) during my visit on Tuesday. (This is not a complaint.)\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen play began, it was apparent that Rublev – who defeated Roger Federer this summer in Cincinnati – was not going to be outhit. He hits the ball hard off both wings, with the only evident weakness in his game being a second serve that sometimes dipped below 80 mph (or 129 kph). Tsitsipas spent much of the match trying to figure out how to attack that delivery, and ventured to the net far more often than Rublev, but was unable to apply consistent pressure to Rublev’s service games.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the opening game, Rublev added injury to insult: on break point, he passed Tsitsipas, who lunged unsuccessfully for the ball, jamming the fingers of his left hand on the court as he stopped himself from falling. If anyone can get over an injury to his non-dominant hand, it may be Tsitsipas, who is old school with his one-handed backhand. In any event, what looked at first like it might be a serious injury passed without incident, and Tsitsipas played on, though perhaps the mishap foreshadowed physical problems to come.\\n\\n\\n\\nRublev soldiered on through the first set, saving two break points in the sixth game – the second when Tsitsipas tried to jump on a 78 mph second serve, but instead shanked his forehand and hit the return into the stands – and eventually served out the set, 6-4.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the second set, Rublev broke serve for a 2-1 lead, but Tsitsipas broke right back. In the tiebreak that eventually ensued, Tsitsipas surged ahead 5-2 and had two service points coming up, but he missed two forehands to cede the mini-break advantage. No matter: Rublev mishit a backhand while serving at 4-5 to level the tiebreak. On his second set point, Tsitsipas evened the match with a crosscourt forehand winner.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the third set, Rublev saved a break point in the third game and then squandered six break chances in the fourth. Tsitsipas, serving at 2-3, 40-15, dropped four consecutive points to fall behind in the set, but then broke back to get to 3-4. From there, the players held serve until they played another tiebreak. Tsitsipas drew first blood, moving from defense to offense and winning the point with a drop volley to seize a mini-break and a 3-1 lead. He returned the mini-break when he netted a backhand on the seventh point. Serving at 5-5, Tsitsipas worked his way to net, but – as happened several times in the match – Rublev anticipated where the approach shot would go, and Tsitsipas could not handle his backhand pass. Now it was set point for the Russian, on his serve. Tsitsipas punished an 83 mph second serve to get to the sanctuary of 6-6. He took yet another point off Rublev’s serve with a big inside-out forehand, giving himself a set point on his own serve. After a long rally, however, Tsitsipas sailed a backhand volley long to make it 7-7. On his next service point, he dropped a makeable backhand volley into the net, giving Rublev set point on his serve. This time, Rublev got the job done, as Tsitsipas’s forehand return of serve went long.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the third set, Tsitsipas called for the trainer, and he visibly cramped during much of the fourth set. Tsitsipas saved three break points in the third game and another in the fifth, after which the trainer returned to work on him. Tsitsipas’s best chance to fight on came and went in the sixth game, when he came up empty on seven break points, allowing Rublev to reach 3-3.\\n\\n\\n\\nTsitsipas, moving gingerly, was called for a time violation in the seventh game, and eventually dropped serve. Another time violation in the next game gave Rublev a free point coming out of the changeover. The time violations provoked a tirade, which I did not hear, in which Tsitsipas told the umpire that he was a weirdo. (As is well known, the Greeks don’t want no freaks.) With the finish line in sight, however, Rublev faltered. Serving for the match at 5-4, he opened with two double faults, the latter including a second serve that hit the bottom of the net. Tsitsipas grabbed the next two points to break at love and stay alive at 5-5.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the ensuing game, however, Tsitsipas’s difficulty moving came back to bite him. Serving at 30-0, he dropped four consecutive points, the penultimate one when he could not run for a Rublev down-the-line backhand. Given another chance to serve out the match, Rublev made no mistake, dropping just one point and closing out a 6-4 6-7(5) 7-6(7) 7-5 upset victory.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe match had lasted two minutes short of four hours, so I took a lunch break in the Chase Lounge before snagging a seat at Court 10, where Hyeon Chung was facing Ernesto Escobedo in the shadow of the venue where my wife and I got married seven years ago. Both players are members of the class of 1996, Escobedo having been born a month and a half after Chung, on July 4. Chung has had the more accomplished career, breaking into the top twenty last year after defeating Alexander Zverev and Novak Djokovic on the way to the semifinals of the Australian Open. After struggling with injuries, however, he entered this year’s US Open as a qualifier, ranked 170th in the world. Escobedo, whose high-water mark came at number 67 in 2017, is now number 206, making the tournament by virtue of his success in the wild card challenge. The only prior meeting of the two, last year, resulted in an easy victory for Chung in Acapulco.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I arrived, Escobedo broke Chung to take a 5-3 lead in the first set, then served it out. Escobedo was wearing ugly shorts, perhaps hoping they would serve as a talisman, as they had for Stan Wawrinka at Roland Garros in 2015. Slightly shorter than Chung but serving harder, Escobedo broke again to start the second set and cruised to a 4-2 lead. He had two break points to make it 5-2, but Chung captured four straight points to hold. In the next game, Escobedo was up 30-0 before Chung pulled off another string of four points to break serve and level the set. In the tenth game, Chung broke at 15 to cap a run of four consecutive games and steal the set.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the third set, which featured a middle-aged ballboy who was not quite so spry as his younger colleagues but brought back memories of another superannuated ballboy, Chung had two break points and Escobedo six, but none were converted, so the players went to a tiebreak. Escobedo took a mini-break for a 3-2 lead and husbanded the edge to set point at 6-4, but hit a forehand long after a long rally, giving Chung a chance to level the breaker on his serve. At 5-6, Chung hit a deep backhand, and Escobedo gambled by stopping play and asking for a Hawk-Eye review of the line call. Hawk-Eye is now available on all the courts, including the somewhat forsaken Court 10, and Escobedo’s gamble paid off: the ball was just long, and the set belonged to the American.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the players battled on, national identification came to the fore in the stands. A large Korean contingent chanted for Chung, with the only word I could understand being “Hyeon.” Some leather-lunged Americans shouted “USA! USA!” or “Let’s go, Esco.” I’m ordinarily not one for jingoism, but I thought it a hopeful sign that American fans could view a countryman of Mexican extraction as one of their own.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fourth set was relatively uneventful, with the lights going on at 4-4, when the clock struck 6:06. At deuce in that game, Chung produced the first break point of the set with a down-the-line forehand passing shot – throughout the match, Escobedo spent a lot more time at the net than his opponent – and sealed the game when his backhand return of an Escobedo second serve clipped the line. Chung wrapped up the set at love, so we would go to a deciding set.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe opening of the fifth set was all Chung, as he broke serve twice for a 3-0 lead and withstood two break points to reach 4-0. The score almost went to 5-0, as Escobedo had to fight off two break points before holding for 1-4, but thereafter Chung held serve twice, closing out a 3-6 6-4 6-7(5) 6-4 6-2 victory with an ace, his sixteenth of the match, wide in the deuce court. In the end, Escobedo’s shorts were evidently not ugly enough.\\n\\n\\n\\nI often flit from court to court at the US Open, but I had secured a good seat, behind the court, and now the main attraction was Gaël Monfils, who had more fans than there were seats on Court 10, so I was not going anywhere. I have seen Monfils several times, including two retirements: against Illya Marchenko in 2015 and Kei Nishikori last year. This year, I wanted to see him in full flight.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Monfils’s match against Albert Ramos Viñolas, there were many fans who stood on the top bench of the bleachers on the adjoining Court 9, turning their backs to the local action and craning to see our match. Until this point, I had been watching players 23 and younger (Tsitsipas and Rublev probably didn’t recognize Devo’s Whip It, which played during one of their changeovers), but both of these competitors were over 30.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor most of his career, Monfils has held his feet together while preparing to serve. As has been the case in recent years, however, he has gone to a more conventional stance, starting with his feet apart. He still has his characteristic crouch while receiving serve and occasionally does his old-man thing, hunching over to lean on his racquet as though it were a cane.\\n\\n\\n\\nMonfils had won the first three matches between the two, all easily, but Ramos Viñolas turned the tables with a 6-3 6-1 victory in Rome earlier this year. Serving at 1-1 in the opening set, Monfils fell behind 0-40. He saved two break points before Ramos Viñolas sent a laser beam off his left-handed forehand down the line for a winner and the lead. Monfils raced ahead in the next game by 0-40, breaking at 15 with a beautiful backhand drop shot to get even.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were no more breaks in the set, but the first four points of the tiebreak, and seven of the first eight, went against serve. At 5-2, Monfils stepped to the line and broke the pattern, producing an ace and a winning serve-and-volley to close out the set.\\n\\n\\n\\nMonfils raced to a 5-1 lead in the second set, behind two breaks of serve, and had three set points when Ramos Viñolas served the seventh game. But Ramos Viñolas escaped the trap (with Monfils – being Monfils – doing a 360-degree pirouette at net on the first of the set points) and then broke Monfils in the next game. The second time the Frenchman served for the set, he fell behind by 15-40 but got out of the jam with a big serve-and-forehand combination and a leaping backhand volley. Upon reaching set point, Monfils produced a backhand down the line that landed in the corner, on the baseline, to take the set, 6-4.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe third set proved less perilous for Monfils, who broke serve for a 3-2 lead and, not taking any chances, broke again in the ninth game to close out the match, 7-6(2) 6-4 6-3. By then, it was close to 9:30 p.m. I could have gone back into Armstrong for the night session, as the upper bowl in the stadium is open to holders of day session tickets, but the match I wanted to see, between the unhappy warrior Nick Kyrgios and Steve Johnson, was on track to start quite late: the day session had run past 7:00 p.m., and the all-Belarussian match between Aryna Sabalenka and Victoria Azarenka that opened the night session on Armstrong was destined to go the distance. Kyrgios and Johnson eventually got onto court after 11:00 p.m. and played until 1:00 a.m., with more controversy for Kyrgios, as is his wont. But I was back home on this three-match day before the Aussie had a chance to do his thing, saving energy for another visit to the Open.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['Opening Day at Flushing Meadow\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 25, 2014\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpening day at the US Open is a time for decisions. There’s so much to see that triage is necessary. In my case, this involved a snap decision to change my first match of the day. I was ready to camp out on Court 11 to watch Benoit Paire and Julien Benneteau – and that would have been a fine decision, since the match went to five sets and resulted in a mild upset, with Paire victorious (notwithstanding his continual foot-faulting during his pre-match practice session – note: hyperlinks highlighted in red are to photographs that I’ve posted on Twitter; a full complement of photo links appears on my Twitter feed) – but there was no place to hide out in the shade on Court 11, and the backless seats did not bode well for a long day. So I picked up my belongings and moved to the more luxurious Court 17, where both shade and backs were available, to watch Rafael Nadal’s conqueror at Wimbledon, 19-year-old Nick Kyrgios, take on the 21st seed, a 32-year-old Ph.D. and father of two, Mikhail Youzhny.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fans mostly supported Kyrgios, though there were a couple of Youzhny enthusiasts in my row. The Youzhny supporters had nothing to match Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi, which was heard early and often.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly on, Kyrgios had the edge, but he had trouble forging ahead. Youzhny held serve in a very long opening game, and the players remained on serve till the eleventh game, when Kyrgios stormed back from 40-15 on the Russian’s serve to break. He served out the set and broke again to open the second set. In retrospect, the match began to turn when Youzhny saved two break points in the sixth game. After Youzhny went through one of several visits from the trainer, the emphasis being on his shoulder and neck, he broke serve in the eighth game to square the set. Kyrgios won the tiebreak, 7-4, but his aura of invincibility on serve was no more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYouzhny came out charging in the third set, breaking twice to take it easily. In the fourth set, Youzhny jumped out to a 3-1 lead, as Kyrgios drew a game penalty from the umpire Alison Hughes for an audible obscenity, his third code violation of the match. One more, and he would be defaulted. But then the match turned again, with Kyrgios saving a set point before holding for 4-5, breaking Youzhny with a backhand down the line for 5-5, and eventually running away with the tiebreak, 7-1. The “young Jedi of the tiebreak” had done it again, his big serve, which was good for 26 aces, and forehand leading him past a seasoned veteran with one of the most versatile one-handed backhands on tour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was a “lottery match” (also known as a Simpson’s Paradox match) with Youzhny winning 157 points to Kyrgios’s 156. In the tiebreaks, however, Kyrgios won 14 of 19 points. One did not get the sense that it was all, or even mostly, luck: Kyrgios will be a force in major tournaments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn a hot late summer day, I decided to take a break in the Chase Lounge, which is available, on a limited basis, to customers of the bank. (I’m planning to return to the US Open twice this year, but I was able to sign up for the lounge only for this session.) I walked all the way from Court 17 past the crowded food court to get to the lounge, only to be told that I had to go back to the Chase kiosk on the other end of the food court in order to check in and get my bracelet for admission. In past years, the security guards at the lounge had a list of those with reservations, but this year’s innovation was to move that list to a distance of at least a five-minute walk, given the crowds. How can this possibly make sense? Chase gets a big thumbs-down for this decision, but at least I eventually got some air conditioning and lemonade.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeaving the lounge, I caught the final game of Alla Kudryavtseva’s 2-6 6-2 6-4 win over her fellow qualifier Ying-Ying Duan on Court 8. My interest in the match stemmed from that of two of my young cousins, who were enjoying the day with their grandfather. Last week, they had taken a shine to Kudryavtseva in the qualifying, when she posed for a photo with them after a win. This time, they cheered her on and were rewarded with autographs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI then repaired to Court 6 to watch Camila Giorgi, who would have been seeded if the tournament had started a week later, face the Russian-Australian veteran Anastasia Rodionova, a qualifier. Before I got there, I passed Ryan Harrison on the grounds and snapped this photo. Here’s a multiple-choice question:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Harrison dour because:\\n\\n\\n\\na) that’s his standard demeanor;\\n\\n\\n\\nb) it was a hot day in New York;\\n\\n\\n\\nc) he got another tough draw at a major tournament (facing Grigor Dimitrov in the first round); or\\n\\n\\n\\nd) all of the above?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCourt 6 is part of a redesigned area of the National Tennis Center, with a long runway providing a view of Courts 4, 5, and 6 on one side and practice courts on the other. Unfortunately, Court 6 remains somewhat low rent: there is no speed gun for serves, no Hawk-Eye for review of line calls, and not even a singles net; rather, there was a doubles net propped up by sticks in the alleys.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I arrived, Giorgi was finishing up a routine 6-1 first set. Rodionova, who was sporting long white tube socks à la Bethanie Mattek-Sands, frequently threw up her hands in frustration: Giorgi was walloping the ball, and there was nothing much Rodionova could do about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Giorgi, who hits a flat, hard ball, barely reduces the speed of her second serve, and stood inside the baseline to return Rodionova’s serve, began to miss in the second set. She served for the match at 5-4 but was broken at love. She was broken again to drop the set, 7-5, and her controversial father, Sergio (seen here with the long gray hair and gray T-shirt), could barely bear to look at the court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe beat went on in the third set, as Giorgi continued to misfire, eventually tallying 14 double faults. Her serve was hardly the only problem, but it stood out: a couple of faults bounced before they reached the net. This was another lottery match, as Giorgi won 99 points to Rodionova’s 96, but Rodionova – cheered on by a fellow wearing credentials around his neck who seemed to know her from her role with the Washington Kastles, yelling “Come on, Kastles, sense of urgency” and, frequently, “Come on, Rodie” – deserved the win. The US Open’s statistics were incomplete from this orphan court, so we don’t have full tallies of winners and errors, but my sense was that Giorgi probably finished 70% of the points. Rodionova’s job was to get the ball back and hope that the bulk of the 70% would tilt from winners to errors, and it did. This was the second time I’d seen Rodionova upset a much higher-ranked player at the Open, as she did the same to Sabine Lisicki in a memorable match in 2009, but this win had to be particularly sweet for a 32-year-old player who is not universally loved by her peers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was also a sweet victory for me. Earlier in the day, while we sat in the shade on Court 17, my young cousins insisted that my shirt was orange, while I contended that it was yellow and wondered who had been smoking what. On Court 6, where we could no longer avoid the sun, they conceded that my shirt was yellow, so I had that going for me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy next stop was Armstrong, where I saw Milos Raonic, featuring an iridescent shirt and sneakers, take some target practice (as a spectator described it) against the Japanese qualifier Taro Daniel. I arrived midway through the first set, catching Raonic’s first break of Daniel’s serve. Three more breaks were to follow, and Raonic would not be broken until he served for the match at 5-4 in the third set. The big Canadian recovered from that hiccup to run through the tiebreak and win the match, 6-3 6-2 7-6(1). Along the way, he served 20 aces, including one second serve clocked at 140 mph. (I don’t know why the US Open’s website shows his hardest serve of the match at 138 mph.) Daniel has a nice forehand, which he whips after cocking his wrist, but he’s just not in Raonic’s league. I was pleased to see Raonic experiment with the dying art of serve-and-volley, often behind slice or twist first serves. This explains why the statistics show an average first-serve speed of 120 mph; the serves were not all bombs, unless he was staying back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI returned to Court 6 to see Jérémy Chardy in the third set of a tussle with the left-handed Alejandro Falla. Falla had pocketed the first set with a 7-5 tiebreak, while Chardy stormed back to take the second, 6-2. What followed was, in a way, the opposite of what I had seen earlier on Court 6. This time, the higher-ranked, more skilled player got through patches of rough play (including 10 double faults) to squeeze past the opponent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFalla served for the third set at 5-4 but was broken when Chardy moved out wide on Falla’s second serve to pound a forehand return. Chardy broke again when Falla served at 5-6, capping the game with an inside-in forehand winner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile this was going on, Michael Llodra’s farewell tour was visible on the adjoining Court 5, as he faced Daniel Gimeno-Traver. Apropos of Llodra’s net play, which truly is a throwback to the Becker/Edberg days, or perhaps Laver/Rosewall, a spectator on Court 6 said in appreciation of a winning volley: “Like butter, man.” We also heard the boom of fireworks from nearby Ashe, as the opening night ceremonies got underway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the fourth set, Chardy again fell behind by a break, but evened the set in the eighth game. Falla, whose defining memory must be a devastating loss to Roger Federer at Wimbledon in 2010, served at 4-5, needing to hold to stay in the match. He made no first serves on five points, three of which, including match point, ended in double faults, for a total of 18 in 146 service points. It was no way to end a day’s work, and Falla angrily slammed his racquet into his bag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was by now 8:30, and though some of the day session remained to play out, I called it a night, hoping to save some energy for a return to the Open on Thursday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['End of Summer\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 3, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a bittersweet element to the US Open. On Labor Day weekend, it seems like the whole world descends upon the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. After Labor Day (for non-US readers, that coincides with the second Monday of the tournament), the crowds thin out until the culmination of the tournament, and even then they are almost all packed into Ashe. And then, in the blink of an eye, another summer is gone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt age 18, Denis Shapovalov is probably not too wistful about the end of summer. He’s in a hurry chasing tennis balls, ranking points, and, incidentally, dollars. On a rainy Sunday morning, his match against Pablo Carreno Busta, under the roof in Arthur Ashe Stadium, was the only game in town. Shapovalov made a splash this summer with his upset wins in an oversized white baseball cap, but today the cap was navy blue (italicized links refer to photographs). His game remains the same: aggressive groundstrokes, including a one-handed backhand, pretty big serving (but with some yips on the toss, which he caught fairly often), and an affinity for the net, albeit one that was not always rewarded. Carreno Busta is in the classic Spanish mode: he’ll stay out there all day and keep getting the ball back, in the expectation that eventually you’ll miss or give him an opening. Thus, he ventured to net 15 times on the match, and Shapovalov came in 44 times. Their success rates were 73% and 61%, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShapovalov drew first blood, breaking for 4-2, and he served for the first set at 5-3, but then his serve deserted him and Carreno Busta broke at 15. When the Spaniard served at 5-6, Shapovalov earned two set points at 15-40 and another after deuce, but Carreno Busta hung on to force a tiebreak, which he dominated, 7-2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis became the pattern of the match, albeit with Carreno Busta taking the lead in the second set and Shapovalov in the third – but it all came down to the tiebreaks. In the end, Carreno Busta prevailed in all three of them, easily, resulting in a score of 7-6(2) 7-6(4), 7-6(3). Cumulatively, then, Carreno Busta won the tiebreaks by a tally of 21-9. In the match as a whole, Carreno Busta’s edge in points was only 128-124, which means that Shapovalov had an edge of 115-107, or 51.8%, on the non-tiebreak points. Usually, winning that percentage of the points is a sure path to victory, and maybe one day it will be for the young Canadian. On this day, the veteran was too steady when it mattered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rain having stopped, my next stop was the Grandstand, where I saw the top seeds in the men’s doubles, Henri Kontinen and John Peers, grab the final three games in a 7-6(3) 6-4 win over the Russians Mikhail Elgin and Daniil (The Coin Tosser) Medvedev. Whenever I’ve seen Kontinen and Peers, the Finn has always seemed like a much better player than the Aussie. Maybe Kontinen sees something subtle about Peers’s game that I’m missing; maybe he’s a loyal guy; or maybe he figures it doesn’t pay to tamper with success – regardless of the tendency of doubles specialists to change partners faster than a National Enquirer\\xad-friendly movie star.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next match on the Grandstand was the highlight of my day, as I got to see the little grinder Diego Schwartzman take on the Frenchman Lucas Pouille. Pouille is listed at 6’1”, but he seemed like a giant next to Schwartzman, generously listed at 5’7” but looking like he still shops in the boys’ department. Schwartzman has the ability to drive opponents crazy, most notably last year, in the final of the one ATP event he has won, when he sent Grigor Dimitrov into a racquet-smashing frenzy. His success at this US Open has prompted learned analysis of the importance of height in tennis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPouille, who eliminated Rafael Nadal at last year’s US Open, took an early lead, breaking Schwartzman in the fourth game after the Argentine had taken a 40-15 lead. The Argentine broke back in the next game. The point of the match came in the eleventh game, when Schwartzman poked a lob volley over Pouille’s head, and Pouille then pulled off a tweener lob for a winner. Schwartzman won the ensuing tiebreak 7-3, closing it out with an inside-out forehand that clipped the tape but still went for a winner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPouille led for most of the second set, breaking Schwartzman twice, but the persistent Argentine secured a second break of his own to level the set at 4-4. With Pouille serving at 5-6 30-40, Schwartzman delivered the goods and a decisive third break with a forehand passing shot, and thus a sudden two-set lead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith the sun a factor early in the third set, Schwartzman turned his baseball cap forward for a period, using the bill to shield his eyes. Pouille came back, dominating the set with two breaks of serve. At 5-2, the trainer worked on Schwartzman’s legs, and the Argentine barely ran in the eighth and final game of the set before receiving more treatment, standing during the break between the third and fourth sets. It seemed questionable whether Schwartzman had anything left to give.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly in the fourth set, Pouille broke Schwartzman at love for a 2-1 lead. But Schwartzman broke back – also at love – for 2-2; gifted with a double fault on break point, he broke again for 4-2. Pouille’s last stand came in the seventh game, when Schwartzman saved three break points, closing it out with an 86 mph second-serve ace up the T. Schwartzman sealed the win, 7-6(3) 7-5 2-6 6-2, with another break of serve, again at love. The match concluded on a review of a double-fault call. Pouille’s challenge was overruled, the US Open had an unlikely quarterfinalist, and I had a picture of a US Open scene: a couple who brought their baby (one of many) to the tournament, near a guy dressed in ’70s garb who was toting a wood racquet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThough Schwartzman is hardly an imposing figure, he somehow managed to serve 9 aces in the match, compared to 15 for Pouille. He won 64% of his first-serve points, not to the standard of the Frenchman’s 69%, but shone on second serve, with an edge of 53% to 41%. The match provided a change from groundstroke grinding, as the players showed creativity in combining drop shots and lobs, as well as frequent forays to the net – 34 for Schwartzman and 28 for Pouille. After the match, Schwartzman said he had worried about his leg in the fourth set, but perhaps Pouille did, too – a theory confirmed by the loser. As the fourth set went on, Pouille appeared to manifest a belief that Schwartzman was fine, as the Frenchman stopped playing drop shots to test his opponent’s mobility. Pouille’s lament was: “It’s not easy to play against someone you’re not sure what’s going on with. I’m hesitating between just putting the ball in the court or being aggressive, and at the end I lose my timing, I get tight and I can’t stay in the match at all. He seemed to get better and better, but I lost my mind on my own and it’s a pity.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery year, I try to see some doubles and some juniors at the Open. I saw plenty of doubles last week, and I filled my junior quota by journeying to Court 13, where the sixth seed in the boys’ singles, the lefthander Yshai Oliel, faced an American wild card, Ryan Goetz, who sports a one-handed backhand. It seems that the USTA is cutting costs: at the junior matches, there are no linesmen on the baselines, with the job of calling those lines falling to the umpire. There is also a 25-second clock intended to keep play moving, but at least in this match it was not enforced.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI arrived early in the first set, after the players had exchanged breaks of serve. From there, the players held serve until the tenth game. Goetz was up 40-30 on his serve, but Oliel won a long rally for deuce. Goetz bravely served and volleyed, but he left Oliel’s return go, only to see it land in the court. At set point, Goetz netted a forehand, and Oliel was up 6-4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStarting the second set, Oliel scrambled out of a 0-40 jam, broke for 2-0, and held for 3-0, a run of five straight games. Goetz pulled off a three-game string of his own, with a hold, a break, and a hold. Again, it was the tenth game that decided matters: serving at 4-5, Goetz fell behind 15-40 and put a forehand into the net on match point. While Oliel had won the contest, 6-4 6-4, he hardly dominated his lower-ranked opponent, and I have to wonder whether he’s got the goods to make a splash on the tour. This being the US Open, however, there is always something new to see: on this occasion, a dog wearing Burberry paid a visit to the court. I can only guess that the fashionable pup was some kind of service animal, a status that can be gamed by a cagey owner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI then repaired to the temporary Armstrong, where Kevin Anderson had won the first two sets against the 35-year-old Italian “foot soldier of tennis” and major-league grunter Paolo Lorenzi, but the Italian had taken the third and was up a break in the fourth. The stadium is not the most comfortable place to watch a match, but fortunately the USTA allowed everyone into the premium seats, so I was able to get closer to the action and have the benefit of a seatback.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe can forgive Lorenzi his grunting, because a man of his age and stature should not have to retrieve the rockets coming off the racquet of a 6’8” behemoth. But, as any good foot soldier might say, this is the business we’ve chosen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShortly after my arrival, Anderson broke back to level the fourth set. Serving at 3-4, Lorenzi fell behind 0-40, but reeled off five consecutive points to stay alive, including one where he had to run down a lob and eventually won the point on an inside-out backhand. The next time Lorenzi served, he fell behind by 0-40 again, and this time there were no answers: a missed backhand on triple match point gave the contest to the South African, 6-4 6-3 6-7(4) 6-4, who improved his career record against Lorenzi to 4-0.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI stayed for the night session, or at least its outset. With the roof open on Ashe on a moonlit night, the third seed, Garbine Muguruza, was taking on Petra Kvitova. Each has won two major titles; the Czech is coming back from a stabbing sustained in a horrific home invasion, but didn’t show any obvious ill effects. Coming into the match, Muguruza had won the first meeting between the pair and Kvitova the next two.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKvitova was the aggressor throughout the match: she was responsible for ending 66 points (with a winner/error ratio of 24/42), as compared to only 32 for Muguruza (7/25). Muguruza broke first for a 3-1 lead, but Kvitova saved three break points in the sixth game to stay in the set and then broke back in the seventh. Muguruza saved a break point at 4-4 but was broken at 5-5. At 6-5, however, Kvitova could not serve out the set, broken at 15. Kvitova fell behind in the tiebreak, losing the first point on her serve, but ran away with it from there, 7-3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMuguruza broke serve to open the second set but Kvitova returned the favor twice. She reached a match point when Muguruza served at 2-5, but misfired, and then it was her task to try to serve out the match. The final game was arduous, as Kvitova had to save three break points, but she was up to the task and closed out the win, 7-6(3) 6-3. With a margin of 81-67 in points won, Kvitova had earned her victory. She had had problems on second serve, winning only 38% of those 37 points, but bagged 78% of her 45 first-serve points and 48% of Muguruza’s service points.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was one more match in the night session, between Sam Querrey and Mischa Zverev, but I was worn out and opted for the subway home. This was either the right call, because the match was no contest, with Zverev netting only five games, or the wrong one, because Querrey reportedly played excellent tennis and, in any event, wrapped up the proceedings in 76 minutes, but my US Open, and thus my summer, were already over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['John McEnroe Joins Sportimes, Does Battle with Breakers and Umpire\\n\\nby Christopher Gerby\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat more can be said about John McEnroe? Over the course of more than three and a half decades in the public eye, he\\'s run the gamut from enfant terrible to elder statesman. Author. Painter. Fledgling musician. Talk show host. Game show host. Arguably the most popular tennis commentator of all-time. The man\\'s name is immortalized in a House of Pain rap lyric, for crying out loud. Love him or hate him, Johnny Mac is a bona fide New York icon who long ago transcended the particulars of his Hall of Fame playing career. The opportunity to watch him ply his classic serve and volley trade in person is roughly the equivalent of watching The Who play \"Baba O\\'Riley\" live.\\n\\n\\n\\nSaid opportunity was one many Capital Region fans took, as the SEFCU Arena was nearly filled to capacity for the New York Sportimes\\' final Albany appearance of 2013. The paying spectators weren\\'t alone in their excitement. One of the court attendants had the access pass hung around his neck autographed by McEnroe. Maria Elena Camerin of the visiting Orange County Breakers even stopped McEnroe early in his pre-match warmup to pose alongside her for a photo (snapped by her doubles partner Coco Vandeweghe). Fellow Breaker Steve Johnson also exchanged some friendly words with McEnroe, but was all business once the match got underway.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst set: men\\'s singles -- Jesse Witten vs. Steve Johnson\\n\\n\\n\\nEasing his way back into World TeamTennis in his season debut, McEnroe opted to sit out the singles. That would bode well for Orange County, who are well represented in this event by Steve Johnson. The two-time NCAA singles champion is something of a WTT rarity: a man currently ranked in the ATP Top 100 who has made himself available for a full season of Team Tennis. Johnson got off to a terrific start here, breaking Jesse Witten at love in the opening game of the match.\\n\\n\\n\\nGame 2 went to deuce -- a single, winner-take-all \"deciding point\" in WTT\\'s no-ad scoring. Johnson won it by handcuffing Witten with a clutch second serve. Witten held serve to get on board, then came up with some sizzling passing shots to put Johnson in serious trouble in Game 4. Once again, the 26-year-old was calm under pressure, brushing away four consecutive break points to hold for 3-1.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere would be a few noteworthy moments in the latter half of the set. McEnroe, from his vantage point on the New York bench, shook his head over a baseline non-call. Music inadvertantly came on in the middle of one rally, forcing a let to be played. But the tennis itself was pretty straighforward, as Johnson settled into a real groove on his serve and comfortably closed out a 5-3 victory.\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: BREAKERS 5, SPORTIMES 3\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the set, a young boy from Schenectady -- named Michael Chang, if you can believe it -- was ushered onto the court to \"interview\" John McEnroe. Keeping a sheepish distance, the boy asked McEnroe \"Why do you like tennis?\"; \"Do you play any other sports?\"; and \"What\\'s your favorite TV show?\" Amidst dutifully replying to all of the above, McEnroe turned the tables. \"I have a question for you. Do you know who I am?\" As the crowd\\'s laughter died down, the nonplussed child replied with a simple, \"Yeah.\" All told, it was nearly as thrilling and intense as the 5-set match McEnroe played against that other Michael Chang at the 1991 US Open.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecond set: mixed doubles -- Peschke/McEnroe vs. Camerin/Huey\\n\\n\\n\\nHow would John McEnroe and Kveta Peschke -- winners of 71 and 25 doubles titles, respectively -- gel as a team? Get this: Treat Huey of the Breakers came up with three aces in the opening game of mixed doubles and STILL couldn\\'t hold serve! On deciding point, McEnroe placed a picture perfect dipping return at Huey\\'s feet to secure the break. Game 2 saw more classic McEnroe, rushing the net behind each of his serves. Maria Elena Camerin did manage to beat him once with a lovely cross-court return. \"Your eyes were open, right?\" McEnroe asked the Italian, who smiled broadly while nodding in the affirmative. \"That\\'s well done,\" he acknowledged, before closing out an otherwise spotless hold for 2-0.\\n\\n\\n\\nPeschke was the star of Game 3, coming up with a winning volley and a winning return on the road to a 15-40 lead. She then clinched the second break of the set, ripping a return that clipped the racquet of a late-reacting Huey. The Sportimes continued to put on a mixed doubles clinic in Game 4, McEnroe spryly popping up from an I-formation crouch a couple times in Peschke\\'s easy hold for 4-0. Camerin and Huey would manage to salvage one set point in the following game, but couldn\\'t avoid the whitewash. On set point number 2, McEnroe struck a curling backhand pass that opened up the court for Peschke. She put away an easy forehand volley, banking the 5-0 win after a mere 14 minutes of play.\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: SPORTIMES 8, BREAKERS 5\\n\\n\\n\\nHe may be 54 years old, with hair that\\'s markedly transitioning from gray to white, but John McEnroe can still show opponents half his age a thing or two on the doubles court. \"The first set was great,� he would say after the match. \"Kveta is a great doubles player to play with. It was fun.� He\\'d hope for more fun as he teamed with longtime Sportimes teammate Robert Kendrick in his second and final event of the evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nThird set: men\\'s doubles -- Kendrick/McEnroe vs. Huey/Johnson\\n\\n\\n\\nThe opening game of men\\'s doubles opened with the first real flash of John McEnroe\\'s legendary temper. After Steve Johnson knifed away a backhand volley on deciding point to break his serve, McEnroe threw his racquet. (To further that Who analogy I made earlier, witnessing this in person is akin to seeing Pete Townsend smash his guitar.) McEnroe may be the greatest doubles player in the history of tennis -- as he was identified in the pre-match introductions -- but the Breakers were paying him no deference now. Midway through Treat Huey\\'s love hold for a 2-0 lead, Johnson buzzed McEnroe\\'s tower with a smash. Johnson did raise his hand in apology (for what was a perfectly legal, common play in doubles), but McEnroe never acknowledged it, keeping his back turned.\\n\\n\\n\\nJohnson kept up his bold heroics in Game 3, whipping a winning pass to set up break point, then finishing the job by lofting a beautiful topspin lob over McEnroe\\'s outstretched racquet. Already down a double break, McEnroe and Robert Kendrick were in danger of being blitzed as badly as the Breakers had been in the mixed. But they found new life in Game 4, coming from behind to force a deciding point. Following his serve into the net, Johnson bricked a low forehand volley, let out an anguished scream, and kicked the ball. The Sportimes were back in the set at 1-3 and back in the overall lead at 9 games to 8.\\n\\n\\n\\nMcEnroe carried the momentum further, smacking back-to-back aces to open Game 5. \"Come on, Johnny!\" enthused one Sportimes supporter. \"Only my mom calls me Johnny,\" McEnroe corrected him. After a service winner wrapped up the love hold for 2-3, a different fan cried out, \"Way to go, Mr. McEnroe!\" John approved of that, grinning as he gave the thumbs up.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Sportimes had a real chance to get back on serve, jumping out to at 15-40 lead against Huey in Game 6. The first break point was on McEnroe\\'s racquet as he lined up a fairly routine backhand volley...and pushed it long. McEnroe stood with his hands on his hips, head down in disbelief. They still had a chance two points later, opting to have Kendrick (who\\'d been seeing the ball well in the last few games) take the return on deciding point. However, \"Kendo\" promptly drilled a return into the net, ending the game in Orange County\\'s favor.\\n\\n\\n\\nThings went from bad to worse for Kendrick in Game 7, as he double faulted twice en route to another deciding point -- this one a set point for Orange County. A very good rally ensued and turned into a mano-a-mano battle between Johnson and McEnroe. The veteran scrambled well, but the man 28 years his junior ultimately prevailed, spanking a winning forehand volley to take the set by a humbling count of 5-2.\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: SPORTIMES 10, BREAKERS 10\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the match, John McEnroe was still haunted by his pivotal miscue on break point in Game 6. \"I missed that one volley. That screwed everything up,\" he said. \"It was an absolute gimme. I believe I don\\'t even need to be awake when I make that shot. I probably would make it in my sleep. That would have made it 3-all. I feel bad.\" Steve Johnson also deserves some credit, but when I asked about his play, McEnroe spoke in general terms. \"Steve, I\\'ve seen him for a while. He\\'s coming along. He\\'s in the Top 100 now. He stepped up a bit, but I\\'ve seen it comin\\'. He\\'s doing well.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFourth set: women\\'s singles -- Anna-Lena Groenefeld vs. Coco Vandeweghe\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s one matchup in which the uniforms worn in World TeamTennis come in handy. Were they not sporting their team colors, you might not have been able to tell one tall, broad-shouldered, baseline-residing, big-forehand-hitting blonde from the other. Coco Vandeweghe (Orange County\\'s tall blonde) is suffering through a miserable season on the WTA Tour. Her ranking has fallen nearly 180 spots in the past year, putting her in danger of missing the cut-off just to enter qualifying at the US Open. But she would likely get a wild card in that case -- maybe even one for the main draw -- since the USTA has always believed in her high ceiling talent. And to her credit, the 21-year-old seems to have found her game on the Team Tennis circuit. Vandeweghe started the night ranked second in the entire league in women\\'s singles.\\n\\n\\n\\nCoco (the niece of former NBA star Kiki Vandeweghe) had a memorable tiff with fiery Russian teenager Yulia Putintseva earlier this year. \"You are a terrible player, only serve. I win all the rallies,\" Putintseva allegedly said after beating Vandeweghe in Brussels. That kind of is the scouting report on Vandeweghe...but what a serve it is! She thumped a pair of aces in her opening service game on Thursday night, then came up with another in closing out a hold for 2-2. Anna-Lena Groenefeld, who\\'d pushed counterpunchers Victoria Duval and Jill Craybas around the court in her previous home matches, was clearly in against an opponent who could fight fire with fire.\\n\\n\\n\\nVandeweghe drove a forehand winner into the corner for a 0-30 lead in Game 5, raising the ire of John McEnroe, who thought the ball was out. McEnroe got up from his seat on the New York bench, approached the umpire, and bellowed, \"You have no idea where it was!\" Undaunted, Vandeweghe picked up right where she left off, smacking a winning return to go up 0-40. Two points later, Groenefeld steered a backhand long to surrender the set\\'s first break. Vandeweghe now led 3-2; her team led in the overall tally 13-12.\\n\\n\\n\\nNegative body language has bedeviled Vandeweghe for much of her young career, but for this night she played with a smile plastered on her face. The positive attitude correlated with some very impressive tennis as she blasted her way through a dominant hold for 4-2 and charged to a 15-40 lead in Game 7. Groenefeld saved the first set point with a good overhead smash, but Vandeweghe kept right on smiling. Groenefeld followed with a forehand error on the very next point, putting the finishing touch on a crowd-deflating 5-2 loss. Coco Vandeweghe, meanwhile, exchanged a serious of exuberant high fives with her Orange County teammates. If she can keep producing the brand of consistent, aggressive tennis she played in this set, she\\'ll be a real factor in the future of American tennis...no matter what Yulia Putintseva thinks.\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: BREAKERS 15, SPORTIMES 12\\n\\n\\n\\nFifth set: women\\'s doubles -- Groenefeld/Peschke vs. Camerin/Vandeweghe\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the New York Sportimes had to claw out of a 3-game hole in the final event of the night, Anna-Lena Groenefeld and Kveta Peschke were the players they wanted on court to do it. They were unbeaten as a pair to this point in the WTT season, winning all 7 of their sets by a combined total of 35 games to 18. However, the Orange County Breakers were riding a wave (pun intended) of serious momentum after Coco Vandeweghe\\'s blistering performance in singles. After a Groenefeld double fault and a terrific Camerin return, the Sportimes were already in a 15-30 hole to open the set. It would go downhill from there. Way, way downhill.\\n\\n\\n\\nA rally on the fourth point came to a very abrupt end. \"Touch play!\" the umpire interjected, indicating that Peschke\\'s volley was an illegal double hit. It didn\\'t look like one from where I was sitting, nor did it look that way to anyone on the Sportimes. Their bench practically erupted, with coach Claude Okin and (naturally) John McEnroe joining Peschke in a heated exchange with the umpire. McEnroe carried his tirade on the longest, excoriating the umpire for allegedly having a personal bias against him and taking it out on his teammates. The umpire didn\\'t take kindly to that: he assessed McEnroe a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct. As the team\\'s second code violation, it came with an automatic point penalty. The questionable call had turned 15-30 into 15-40. The point penalty turned 15-40 into game: a pivotal early break for Camerin and Vandeweghe.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven as the women got play back underway, McEnroe was still ranting at the umpire. \"You screwed up!\" he screamed, finally ending his outburst with a Mamet-esque stanza of \"You suck! You suck!\" If nothing else, this did serve to get the crowd involved. They let out one of the loudest ovations of the night when New York won the opening point of Game 2. Vandweghe quieted them down in a hurry, however, taking the next four points to hold for 2-0.\\n\\n\\n\\nPeschke had her moments (closing out Game 3 with an overhead; tagging Vandeweghe with a volley in Game 4), but most of the on-court action kept going the way of the Breakers. Groenefeld\\'s wretched evening hit its nadir in Game 5, which she opened and closed with double faults. Already up 4-1, Vandeweghe rocketed yet another ace to get to 40-15 and match point. Maria Elena Camerin responded by pantomiming an \"I\\'m not worthy\" bow to her partner, the night\\'s unofficial MVP.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll good things, including the Groenefeld/Peschke winning streak, must come to an end. Anna-Lena dumped a lackluster volley into the net on match point, ending the 5-1 misadventure.\\n\\n\\n\\nFINAL SCORE: BREAKERS 20, SPORTIMES 13\\n\\n\\n\\nAll in all, a pretty horrendous collapse by the New York Sportimes. Fine tennis from Steve Johnson and Coco Vandeweghe lit the fuse, but an escalating series of disputes with the umpire caused the final explosion that blew away what was left of the home team\\'s chances. After the match, I asked John McEnroe if it\\'s fair to say this wasn\\'t the best officiating he\\'d ever seen. \"I think that\\'s fair to say, yeah, but I don\\'t see a lot of good officiating,\" he replied with a devilish grin. \"This topped even the normal. I feel bad for the girls, because it\\'s like a personal -- it has nothing to do with them. I feel like it\\'s just something to do with me and it\\'s too bad that it has to be that way. I\\'d prefer if the guy was gonna do it, just do it to me instead of the whole team.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSummarizing the match as a whole, McEnroe said, \"We started bad, then we got on a roll, then we blew it. We could have come back, but it all just derailed. That\\'s part of why it\\'s fun -- it\\'s unpredictable. It\\'s too bad this other stuff got in the way. We lost 5-2, 5-1 the last couple sets, so you can\\'t necessarily blame the whole thing on that, but it\\'s the same old story.\" While McEnroe has joked that he gets paid to engage in umpire-baiting shtick on the seniors tour, his frustration tonight appeared genuine. Was it? \"I believe it is,\" McEnroe confirmed, rubbing his chin. \"It\\'s frustrating, but it\\'s nothing new. Thank God I\\'m not having to deal it with too often. Other people do a much better job of handling it than I do.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['Three Big Servers\\n\\nAugust 29, 2013\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI began my second visit to this year’s US Open with a match on Armstrong between the eighth-seeded lefthander Angelique Kerber and the promising 19-year-old Canadian Eugenie Bouchard. Bouchard was more of an attacker, while Kerber was a resolute defender (see photo; for a complete set of photos from the day, click here) who turned to offense when the opportunity arose (see photo). Part of Kerber’s defensive posture, literally, was her use of what I’d call the “Radwanska crouch” on balls hit low and deep to her backhand. Bouchard served much harder, averaging 98 and 78 miles per hour, respectively, on first and second serves, while Kerber’s numbers were 86 and 71.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were five breaks of serve in the first set, with Kerber scoring the decisive one at 4-4. She then saved three breaks of serve in the tenth game and put the first set in her pocket.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBouchard looked like she might fade away after she dropped serve in the opening game of the second set, but then she reeled off five straight games. Though she dropped her serve at 5-1, she broke Kerber in the next game to bag the set, 6-2. For the set, Kerber never held serve in four tries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKerber righted the ship in the third set, which began with a black-clad Brad Gilbert walking to his ESPN perch. Not only did she hold serve throughout, she never faced a break point. She broke Bouchard in the first game and again in the ninth to close out the match. The final score: Kerber d. Bouchard 6-4 2-6 6-3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s easy to picture a bright future for Bouchard, who entered the tournament ranked 59th in the world. She has excellent groundstrokes (see photo); her nearly flat backhand is a weapon both crosscourt and down the line. At 5’10”, she’s got the height to compete with the big hitters. If you watched Bouchard play Kerber and never paid attention to the score, you might well conclude that Bouchard was the better player. Only by following the score would you realize that Kerber was winning more of the points (not so many more: 98 to 96), and more of the points that mattered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy next stop was the Chase Lounge (see photo), where my father showed off his seat cushion (see photo) from the 1987 US Open. After that pit stop, I headed out to Court 8 for the conclusion of the latest installment in the ongoing drama of Yoni Erlich and Andy Ram. This on-again/off-again doubles team had its greatest moment when they captured the Australian Open in 2008. Reunited for the Open, they were facing the eleventh-seeded team of Santiago Gonzalez and Scott Lipsky on Court 8. When I arrived, Erlich was preparing to serve for the match at 6-2 5-3. He went 0-for-5 on first serve, but his team prevailed all the same (see photo).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI then staked out a place in the Grandstand for the match between Ana Ivanovic and Alexandra Dulgheru. I was not so interested in this match – nor, as it turned out, did the match warrant much interest – but I wanted to get a decent seat to see Sam Querrey and then Milos Raonic. Part of going back to the US Open every year is the feeling of tradition, which was underscored for me when I saw the familiar dreadlocked usher (see photo) who regularly works the shaded side of the Grandstand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIvanovic, once No. 1, is the thirteenth seed this year. Dulgheru has been ranked as high as No. 26 but sat at No. 214 going into the Open. That she was not required to play qualifying is attributable, I’m guessing, to an injury-protected ranking. This certainly seemed to be the case if you saw her protective gear: a brace on her left knee and extensive physio tape on her right shoulder (see photo).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith Dulgheru serving in the second game, there was a break in play when an elderly spectator received medical attention (see center of photo, above the exit from the Grandstand) – but then it turned out that Ivanovic was also being treated by the trainer. Whatever was troubling her did not persist, as she breezed through the match, 6-2 6-1.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere followed a compelling match between Sam Querrey, the twenty-sixth seed, and France’s Adrian Mannarino. The French lefthander, beginning at age 25 to show signs of male pattern baldness (see photo; been there, done that), reached the fourth round of Wimbledon this year. Querrey stumbled out of the gate and, after a lengthy game, had his serve broken. Mannarino played with guile, using his slice serve in the ad court to trouble his opponent (what Bud Collins called a “can opener” when used by John McEnroe) and often deliberately hitting short, low approach shots. In both the ad and deuce courts, he lined up to serve at some distance from the center of the court, and he handled high backhands in the Marcelo Rios “jump shot” manner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMannarino cruised through his service games till he served for the first set, at which point Querrey broke at love. Mannarino overcame the disappointment and won the set in a tiebreak, 7-4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second set saw no breaks of serve, but Querrey found himself in big trouble when he fell behind in the tiebreak, 3-6. He saved two set points on his serve, but Mannarino closed out the set when Querrey shanked a forehand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe third set was also devoid of breaks. It didn’t feel as though the returners were without possibilities, but that’s how it went. The key mini-break came with Mannarino serving at 4-5. He hit his usual slice serve to Querrey’s backhand – over the course of the match, he kept Qurrey honest by mixing in a flat serve up the middle – and then tried to wrong-foot Querrey, but pulled the ball wide. Mannarino hit a beautiful crosscourt backhand to save Querrey’s first set point, but Querrey finished off the set with a 131 mph serve up the middle, followed by an unreturnable inside-out forehand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fourth set looked like it would follow its predecessors into a tiebreak, but Querrey suddenly broke down at 4-5 30-30. Mannarino belted a forehand down the line, and Querrey’s forehand reply sailed long. At match point, Querrey pulled a backhand wide, and it was over. His serve had been broken only twice all day: in the first and last games of the match. The score was 7-6(4) 7-6(5) 6-7(5) 6-4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuerrey was the first big server I had seen on Thursday, and two more were to follow. Staying on the Grandstand, I watched the tenth seed, Milos Raonic, face off against Pablo Andujar. This match had about as much drama as Ivanovic’s had, because Raonic clearly had too much firepower for his Spanish opponent, whose 7-17 record in majors prior to this year’s US Open concealed a slate of 2-11 outside Roland Garros.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was the first time I had seen Raonic in person. His service motion was just as I had recalled it from television: he holds his racquet flat, like a frying pan, as he prepares; when he uncoils, the ball comes off his strings with a loud report. His fastest serve of the match traveled at 143 mph. If you’re sitting behind the receiver as Raonic serves up the middle, you had better pay attention.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRaonic cruised through the first two sets, 6-1 6-2. He mixed in some serve-and-volley: not behind his cannonball, but on occasion when he used his kick serve, on either the first or second ball. He ran around many a backhand, but he also hit his backhand well, except for times when he tried to pull the trigger too early in a rally or from too defensive a position. Sometimes, he volleyed with devastating effectiveness, and it looked like a big man was taking on the junior varsity. He also missed a lot of volleys, however, evincing sloppiness that will not fly against the top players. (According to the US Open’s website, Raonic hit 15 volley winners but also missed 10 volleys.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the third set, Raonic seemed to take his foot off the gas. After he broke serve in the opening game, Andujar broke back. Having regained the lead with a break in the seventh game, Raonic fell behind 0-40 in the eighth, and looked plaintively at his coach, Ivan Ljubicic, before digging out of the hole. By my count, Raonic had four break points (and thus match points) when Andujar served at 3-5, but he could not cash them in. Finally, he served out the match in the tenth game and seemed relieved (see photo) that what had once been a cakewalk had ended.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRaonic is one of the outstanding young talents in the sport, and it often takes attacking players longer to develop. Still, does he have what it takes to reach the top five? To win major titles? I am unsure. For what it’s worth, I cannot think of a more likely candidate to break into the winner’s circle at the majors, unless one is very fond of Jerzy Janowicz’s prospects.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy third big server of the day was the thirteenth seed, John Isner. This match, played on Armstrong, began after nightfall. It was to conclude after the night session was done, just before midnight, but it was technically a day match.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIsner, plodding and uncreative, faced the enigmatic, athletic, entertaining Gael Monfils. It’s hard to believe that Monfils is younger than Isner, as he’s been playing the majors since 2005 and has lately been dealing with knee and back injuries, so that it feels like his career is winding down.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I arrived, Monfils was serving at 5-6 in the first set, and Isner cashed in the last of four break points to grab the set. In the second set, Isner looked like a dynamic player, hitting effectively off the ground and even running for balls more than is his wont. He broke serve twice and cruised, 6-2. For the most part, Monfils was hitting his first serve from the mid-eighties to 100 mph, evidently in furtherance of a strategy to deny Isner a look at second serves. For the match, Monfils made 83% of his first serves, which is remarkable, but perhaps not as remarkable at Isner’s 70%, since the American was trying to pulverize the ball. While Monfils averaged 100 mph on his first serve and 93 mph on his second, Isner’s figures were 128 and 108.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMonfils, clad in orange and black (see photo), came to life in the third set, even after collapsing behind the ankle with what looked like an ankle problem. Isner came to check on his opponent (see photo), and Monfils got up and continued to play. By the time Isner served at 4-4 0-40, the crowd was chanting Mon-fils, Mon-fils, which only got louder when the Frenchman cashed in the third of the break points and danced off the court. Monfils served out the set at love.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe crowd got increasingly exuberant in the fourth set, especially as Monfils climbed out of 0-30 deficits at 4-5 and 5-6. The ride came to a sudden end in the tiebreak, when Monfils served at 4-5. First, Isner grabbed a mini-break with an inside-out forehand winner. On match point, Monfils’s forehand passing shot found the net, and Isner had a 7-5 6-2 4-6 7-6(4) victory. The players hugged at the net.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIsner later complained that the American crowd had not supported its countryman, but New York is a cosmopolitan city, and the fans (many of whom come from overseas to attend the Open) rooted for the more creative player. It didn’t help that Isner seems to give up on balls that are within reach, while Monfils dives recklessly for anything within reach. Isner won fair and square, but Monfils won the fans’ hearts – fair and square.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOf the three big servers, Querrey is out of the tournament, and it’s hard to imagine Isner winning it. Indeed, his next opponent, Philip Kohlschreiber, beat him at the Open last year. Raonic is the big question mark. He could be great, or his story may always be “what might have been.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['Last Day on Armstrong\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 5, 2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLast year, I lamented the demise of the old Grandstand, only to have it survive for another year, but I don’t think we’ll be so lucky with Armstrong, which, to all accounts, is really going to be demolished – along with the old Grandstand – this year. On the second Monday, my wife and I had the opportunity to attend Armstrong for our last time, with the stadium scheduled to be used only one more day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur first match featured Simona Halep and Carla Suarez Navarro. When play started, the unreserved portions of Armstrong were already crowded (italicized hyperlinks refer to photographs), while the reserved seats behind the court, where we were fortunate to be, were not.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThough the players had split ten previous matches, Halep, with coach Darren Cahill sitting courtside (in a green sweater and black Adidas cap), raced to a 4-0 lead, albeit needing a marathon game to secure her second break of serve. Suarez, owner of a beautiful one-handed backhand, drew to within 2-4, but the first set slipped away in the seventh game, when she recovered from 0-40 all the way to ad in, before being broken. Halep closed out the set, 6-2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second set was far more competitive. Halep’s power hitting gave her a break for 2-1, but Suarez broke back right away. Halep registered a seemingly decisive break in the seventh game and later served for the match at 5-4. Suarez cranked up her groundstrokes at 30-30, with a big service return setting up break point and then a backhand that hit the line – as confirmed when Halep expended her final challenge – squaring the set at 5-5.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis, however, was Suarez’s last hurrah. Halep broke at 15 for a 6-5 lead and then, in her second try at serving out the match, recovered from 15-30 to prevail, 6-2 7-5.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUsually, I roam the grounds, but we had good seats in Armstrong, so I stayed for Stan Wawrinka versus Illya Marchenko. Had Nick Kyrgios not pulled up lame in the prior round (which is becoming a habit for Marchenko, who benefited from a Gael Monfils retirement at last year’s Open), he would likely have faced Wawrinka in a reprise of their famous sledging match. Perhaps the ghoulish skulls on Marchenko’s shirt, part of the same ugly Hydrogen outfit previously seen on Jozef Kovalik this year, are associated with his ability to elicit injuries from his opponents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWawrinka took an early lead, breaking serve in the second game on his fourth try. In the fifth game, Marchenko broke back, but he fell behind 15-40 in the tenth game and dropped the set on the second break point, when his inside-out forehand sailed wide.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWawrinka raced to a 5-1 lead in the second set, breaking twice on Marchenko double faults. (The Ukrainian served 5 aces and 8 doubles; for Wawrinka, the numbers were 8 and 0.) Wawrinka served out the set at 6-1, and I took a Chase Lounge break. On my way out of Armstrong, an usher announced that those who departed could not be guaranteed readmission unless they had reserved seats. To my delight, I noticed the usher’s name tag: my formerly dreadlocked favorite is named Benjamin Johnson. When I least expected it, one of life’s little mysteries had solved itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile I was cooling off, Wawrinka had held serve from a 15-40 deficit and then broke for a 3-2 lead in the third set. I was back in my seat by the time Wawrinka served for the match at 5-4, and he quickly went ahead 30-0. The Swiss abruptly went off the rails, dropping four consecutive points to allow Marchenko to tie the set.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the next game, Stanimal held two break points, but Marchenko fended them off to lead 6-5. Wawrinka held serve to force a tiebreak, and he grabbed a mini-break on the first point when he opened the court with a backhand down the line and then put away a forehand down the line. Wawrinka’s grip on the match was weak, however. He gave back the mini-break on the third point, and on the last point with the wind at his back pulled a backhand wide to fall behind, 4-2. There were no more mini-breaks after that, which meant that Marchenko captured the tiebreak, 7-5, after Wawrinka had saved two set points on his serve.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWawrinka continued to struggle in the fourth set, first holding in a long game, then unable to cash two break points in the second, and then broken in the third. Stan snapped his racquet in frustration, then demolished it against the court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe temperamental display seemed to snap Wawrinka out of his funk. He broke back for 2-2, abetted by one of Marchenko’s double faults, and then broke out love for 4-2. Wawrinka staved off a break point in the seventh game and then served out the match at 30, the final tally being 6-4 6-1 6-7(5) 6-3. The match was more dramatic than the box score might suggest: Wawrinka captured 143 points to 112 for Marchenko. When a player wins 56% of the points, he usually wins the match easily, but it was not that kind of day for Wawrinka. After his five-set ordeal against Daniel Evans, in which he had to save a match point, who knows how much he’ll have left for a resurgent Juan Martin Del Potro?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter Wawrinka had sealed his win, it was time to roam the grounds. I didn’t make it back to Armstrong that day, which means my next time on that court is…never. Oh, well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy next stop was Court 9, where Egypt’s Youssef Hossam and Turkey’s Ergi Kirkin faced Liam Caruana of Italy and Sam Riffice of the United States in boys’ doubles. While the schedule of play referred to Karim Hossam, the ITF and other sources show a 22-year-old Karim Hossam, which would be old for junior tennis by any standard. The Hossam I saw looks like the Youssef shown in the photos here, had a one-handed backhand, and generally stayed back on his serve. (At least once, we were fortunate enough to see all four players at net.) He’s also seeded twelfth in the boys’ singles and has ranked as high as number 8 in the juniors. Kirkin will be 18 in January. Caruana is 18 and accomplished enough to be in the top thirty in the juniors, which doesn’t necessarily bode a professional career. The same is true for Riffice, who is still 17 and has topped out at 26 in the junior rankings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe junior matches this year feature a “serve clock” that counts down from 20 seconds, theoretically obliging the server to start the point before the clock hits zero. I saw the clock strike zero several times in this match and in a junior singles match next door to me, and there were no consequences. In addition, the clock freezes between first and second serves, which leaves a pretty big loophole.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe junior doubles matches are played with no-ad scoring and a match tiebreak in lieu of the third set, so anything can happen. Caruana and Riffice ran away with the first set, 6-1, and were blown away in the second set by the same score. The contest came down to a match tiebreak. Kirkin opened with a double fault, but Caruana gave the mini-break right back with a forehand volley into the net. The next mini-break came at 4-5, when Kirkin’s forehand pass hit the net and skipped over Caruana’s head. Kirkin gave back a mini-break when he poached and netted a backhand volley, but he still got to 9-7 on his serve. A Hossam poach resulted in a forehand volley flying long, so Caruana got to serve at 8-9, but Riffice lifted a backhand volley long, and the match was over, 1-6 6-1 [10-8].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI then went to the new Grandstand, which is redundant, I suppose, now that the old Grandstand (or Practice Court 6) is out of action. There, the fourth-seeded men’s doubles team of Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares, current holders of the Australian Open crown, was up a set on Brian Baker and Marcus Daniell. With six surgeries behind him, Baker’s career has been, for want of a better word, tragic. By making the third round in doubles, he and Daniell earned $40,000 as a team, but that number would go up to $75,000 if they were to win this match. (The winning teams in men’s and women’s doubles make a handsome $625,000; in mixed doubles, the top prize is only $150,000.) One would have to be stone-hearted to begrudge Baker a handsome payday, but he and Daniell were up against a very skilled team.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMurray (see any familial resemblance to Andy?) and Soares received serve with their forehands up the middle: the left-handed Murray played the deuce court, while Soares played the ad court. As the wind kicked up in the second set, Baker and Daniell had a golden opportunity: with all four players at net, Baker put away a forehand volley to get to break point as Murray served at 4-4. The crisis passed when Murray and Soares ran off three straight points to hold, and eventually the set went to a tiebreak.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the teams changed ends, the underdogs were leading by 4-2, but Baker netted a forehand volley to give back the mini-break. Baker put his team back in front, 5-4, with a return of a Murray second serve that hit the line, as confirmed when Murray challenged the call unsuccessfully. Immediately thereafter, however, Baker netted a backhand volley. With the teams on serve, Daniell served at 6-7, and Baker saved the match point with a forehand volley. On Daniell’s next service point, Soares put away a backhand volley for a mini-break setting up match point, and then Daniell missed a service return to conclude the match, 6-3 7-6(7). The difference in the match was second serve: Murray and Soares won 55% of their second serve points; Baker and Daniell garnered only 39% on theirs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI concluded my attendance at this year’s US Open with a boy’s doubles match that featured a real pro prospect, 16-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada. Among his accomplishments, he is half of the defending championship team in the event, having won last year with Denis Shapovalov, who won junior Wimbledon this year and is now making noise on the pro tour. Auger-Aliassime is part of the third-seeded team with his countryman Benjamin Sigouin. The two are seeded sixth and ninth, respectively, in the boys’ singles. On Court 14, they faced the Americans Adam Neff, who’s only 15, and Sangeet Sridhar, who is 16 but looks younger with his pipe-cleaner arms and legs. Sigouin and Neff featured the neon yellow Nike outfit that’s been ubiquitous at the Open this year. (And Auger-Aliassime was in Babolat yellow.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I arrived, the Canadians led by 4-1, with one break of serve. Auger-Aliassime served for the set at 5-3. When preparing to serve, he holds his hands apart in an unusual manner. Two double faults helped the Americans get to a 40-40 deciding point, and Auger-Aliassime missed his first serve. But Sridhar’s return sat up enough for Sigouin to put away a forehand volley, and the Canadians were one set to the good.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the second set, Sridhar, the one player who consistently stayed back on his serve, was broken in the opening game on a deciding point; Sigouin returned the favor with a double fault on the deciding point in the second game. The Americans broke Auger-Aliassime for 3-1 when Neff hit an excellent lob, followed by an overhead winner. Neff saved two breaks points (30-40 and 40-40, that is) to hold for 5-2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt 5-3, Sridhar served for the set but was broken at 40-40 when Auger-Aliassime planted a backhand volley between the Americans. The teams held serve from there, sending the set to 6-6. Auger-Aliassime suffered the first mini-break in the tiebreak, as he netted a forehand volley. The Canadians got back on serve when Neff missed a forehand volley on Sridhar’s 5-3 point. Shortly thereafter, Neff served at 5-6, and Sigouin nailed a forehand return. Sridhar couldn’t handle the volley, and the match had ended, 6-3 7-6(5). The Americans had had ample opportunities, despite winning only 57 points compared to their opponents’ 73, but the third seeds were through – and so was I, as the rest of my US Open this year will be followed remotely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s been a good year at the Open, and the grounds are in better shape than they have been, with wider walkways and more good seats on the outside courts. There are even water fountains that will enable you to refill a bottle easily, something I had seen at Wimbledon in June but not previously at Flushing Meadow. Still, I wish the US Open were not so heavily weighted in favor of money: the new Grandstand joins the soon-to-be-defunct Armstrong in reserving all the best seats. If anything, the Grandstand turns up the plutocracy a notch: all the seats on the lower level are reserved, and only those seats have decent backs. Neither was true of the old Grandstand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe days of wandering through the West Side Tennis Club and brushing shoulders with pros are over, and that’s mostly for a good reason: there is greater interest in tennis now. To the extent that interest is driven by corporate box-holders who buy tickets but leave their seats empty, however, the spectator experience is diminished. One can only hope that the next iteration of Armstrong will take these considerations into account and create a balance between maximizing revenue and enhancing the experience of attending the Open.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['Rally Like It\\'s 1999: Serena and Martina Renew Classic Rivalry\\n\\nby Christopher Gerby\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNine and a half years after they last met in a WTA Tour event, Serena Williams and Martina Hingis were set to square off again. This time it was in the long running summer exhibition series known as World TeamTennis, with Serena leading her undefeated Washington Kastles into Albany to face the Eastern Conference\\'s second place team, Martina\\'s New York Sportimes. Hingis, who expressed surprise that it\\'s been nearly a decade since she last met her famous foe, had a strategy in mind. \"Get a lot of balls back, make her work for it. I feel comfortable about my game and I\\'m pretty much on a winning streak. Hopefully I can get as many games I can. I think every game\\'s going to be important against the Kastles. They\\'re the best team right now, but hopefully we can give them a good fight.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the second night in a row, the arrival of Martina\\'s singles opponent was delayed by travel snafus. On Monday, it was Jarmila Gajdosova getting to the SEFCU Arena mid-match after roughly 24 hours in transit from Europe. On Tuesday, it took Williams practically that long to make the trip from Tampa, Florida. One flight scrapped by a mechanical issue and another stuck on a runway for four hours due to bad weather meant the 13-time Grand Slam singles champion would be cutting it close. How close? She set foot in the arena at 7:46 PM...for a match that had been scheduled to start at 7:30. Fortunately, the capacity crowd was patient and gave Serena a rousing welcome when the pre-match introductions finally commenced at 7:54.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst set: mixed doubles -- Hingis/Parrott vs. Williams/Paes\\n\\n\\n\\nNo shortage of major champions on hand here. Even if Rennae Stubbs had taken the place of Serena Williams (which was Washington\\'s contingency plan), all four players involved in the evening\\'s opening event would be Grand Slam mixed doubles champions. Despite a dearth of practice time, Williams opted to play...and promptly fell behind, as Martina Hingis and Travis Parrott sprinted to an early 3-0 lead. The vaunted Williams serve needed little warming up, however, as she held convincingly to get the Kastles on the board at 1-3.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo double faults by Parrott in Game 5 proved costly as Williams and Leander Paes broke the American to get back on serve. Game 6 also went Washington\\'s way. It ended on a stab backhand volley winner by Williams that inspired Paes to give her an \"I\\'m not worthy\" bow. Three games in a row for the visitors put them dead even at 3-all.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, in the seventh game, both teams were playing well simultanteously. It ended with all four players getting involved in a scintillating rally, ultimately won by Parrott with a big overhead smash. The crowd responded with its biggest ovation of the set, but would be on pins and needles soon enough.

Her partner Serena Williams has 20. Martina Hingis owns 37. Her partner Katie O\\'Brien has...an entertaining Twitter feed. Yes, the likable Brit was the weak link here, made all too apparent when she littered her opening service game with two double faults and a backhand error. Stubbs and Williams broke her there for a 2-0 lead. With Serena serving bombs, that was all the cushion the Kastles would need. O\\'Brien redeemed herself somewhat in holding for 2-4, but Stubbs then stepped to the line and quickly closed out a 5-2 victory.\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: KASTLES 9, SPORTIMES 7\\n\\n\\n\\nThird set: men\\'s singles -- Jesse Witten vs. Bobby Reynolds\\n\\n\\n\\nArina Rodionova has been a stalwart member of the Kastles throughout their unbeaten 2011 campaign, but there\\'s no room for her in the lineup when Serena Williams suits up. However, the charismatic Russian was far from idle on Tuesday. She balanced a racquet on her head during the pre-match practice session, played it like a guitar between sets, and busted out quite a few dance moves over the course of the evening. In her most useful role, Rodionova served as the personal towel girl for teammate Bobby Reynolds. She ran out to him after every four points or so throughout his singles encounter with Jesse Witten.\\n\\n\\n\\nFired up and freed from the worries of accumulating perspiration, Reynolds took an impressive 3-1 lead. Witten held for 2-3 and made his opponent work in a tightly contested sixth game, but Reynolds saved himself with an athletic volley on game point. Rodionova was still making eager trips with the towel, Serena was fiddling with a cell phone, and all appeared at peace for the Kastles, who now led the overall match score 13 to 9.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut wait! If the outcome of this set was a forgone conclusion, somebody forgot to inform Witten. The big guy started really getting his teeth into some good rallies, winning eight of the next ten points. The last of those points was a backhand into the tape by Reynolds, securing the first service break for Witten and sending the set to a tiebreak.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJW serving: Witten opens with an unreturnable serve -- 1-0 SPORTIMES\\n\\nJW: Witten keeps his momentum going by uncorking another service winner -- 2-0 SPORTIMES\\n\\nBR: Witten digs out a tough ball on the baseline and returns it for a highlight reel winner -- 3-0 SPORTIMES\\n\\nBR: Reynolds gets on the board when a Witten backhand clips the tape and floats wide -- 3-1 SPORTIMES\\n\\nJW: Witten punctuates a service winner with a cry of \"yes!\" -- 4-1 SPORTIMES\\n\\nJW: \"Could have gone either way,\" hedges the umpire when Witten disputes a double fault call -- 4-2 SPORTIMES\\n\\nBR: Reynolds goes airborne to knock off a winning volley, saving the second set point -- 4-3 SPORTIMES\\n\\nBR: Service winner by Reynolds brings up a mutual set point -- 4-4\\n\\nBR: The packed house erupts in delight after a backhand error by Reynolds ends it -- 5-4 SPORTIMES\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: KASTLES 13, SPORTIMES 12\\n\\n\\n\\nFourth set: women\\'s singles -- Martina Hingis vs. Serena Williams\\n\\n\\n\\nThe marquee matchup of the night didn\\'t get underway until 10:09 PM, by which point some of the spectators had already gone home. What did they miss? Early on, it looked like a carbon copy of the last few Serena-Martina meetings on the WTA Tour. The pure power of Williams was putting Hingis on the defensive time and time again. The last point of the second game was indicative: Hingis forced to take a hand off the racquet and make a desperate one-handed backhand stab which sailed long. That clinched a break for Williams, who led 2-0.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next two games, on the other hand, looked like the hopeful scenario Hingis had painted. A suddenly sloppy Williams gave away the service break in short order, squealing as an unforced backhand error cut her lead to 2-1. Another error off Serena\\'s backhand wing (this one into the net) ended the following game, a routine Hingis hold for 2-all. An exchange of holds followed to make it 3-3.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer groundstrokes were a bit all over the place, but Williams was still serving big and she quickly nudged ahead 4-3. Game 8 opened with Serena drilling a passing shot past Hingis, who sportingly applauded with her racquet. Much the same a few points later, as a dipping pass handcuffed the Swiss, making it 30-40 and bringing up set point. The battle of Martina\\'s steady guile versus Serena\\'s explosive power ended as it began: Williams overwhelmed Hingis with a big forehand down the line to take the set 5 games to 3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a short set,\" Hingis reasoned after the match. \"I felt like I played really well, but some of those passing shots! It was pretty good tennis, right?\" The victorious Williams was also more or less pleased with how their much anticipated duel turned out. \"I love playing Martina, so it\\'s good,\" Williams told the assembled media. \"She\\'s such a good player and more than anything she\\'s a great pratice for me, coming up to these tournaments that I have coming up.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: KASTLES 18, SPORTIMES 15\\n\\n\\n\\nFifth set: men\\'s doubles -- Parrott/Witten vs. Paes/Reynolds\\n\\n\\n\\nThe crowd was really thinning out now, but the outcome of the match remained in doubt. Leander Paes and Bobby Reynolds came in with the best men\\'s doubles record in the league, but it was Paes who was the first player to drop serve. Travis Parrott did the damage, guiding a forehand winner down the line and pumping his fist as the Sportimes went up 3-1. The following game ended with an action-packed rally which saw Parrott and Witten hold firm at the net. They now led 4 games to 1 and had tied the overall match score at 19 apiece.\\n\\n\\n\\nSerena Williams won two of her three battles with Martina Hingis, but could New York\\'s men win the war? What was left of the crowd would find out soon enough. After Reynolds held at love, Parrott served it out for the Sportimes. Authoritatively knifing a backhand volley on set point, Parrott celebrated a 5-2 upset win.\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: SPORTIMES 20, KASTLES 20\\n\\n\\n\\nGreat stuff from Parrott and Jesse Witten, but their work was far from done. When a WTT match is dead even after the five sets have been completed, the players from that final set continue on in a supertiebreak. The first team to seven points would win the match. For the Sportimes, it would mean clinching a playoff berth. For the 11-0 Kastles (already safely assured of a playoff spot), it would mean keeping their perfect record unblemished. If body language and team unity counted for anything, the Kastles appeared to have the edge. Arina Rodionova, Rennae Stubbs, and coach Murphy Jensen were all out on court with Paes and Reynolds -- the five bouncing on their toes in unison as if they were heading into a boxing ring together. Across the net, Parrott and Witten stood stoically by themselves and waited for action to resume...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTP serving: Four-player rally ends with Paes blocking a backhand volley into the net -- 1-0 SPORTIMES\\n\\nTP: The first mini-break comes as Parrott fails to dig out a low forehand volley -- 1-1\\n\\nBR: Paes makes one of his patented flying volley winners and pumps his fist -- 2-1 KASTLES\\n\\nBR: Deft backhand volley winner by Paes -- 3-1 KASTLES\\n\\nJW: Reynolds can\\'t run down a well angled Parrott volley -- 3-2 KASTLES\\n\\nJW: Parrott is a virtual wall at the net, making a nice volley and a winning smash -- 3-3\\n\\nLP: The teams are back on serve after Reynolds pushes a backhand volley wide -- 4-3 SPORTIMES\\n\\nLP: Paes throws an ace out wide -- 4-4\\n\\nJW: Witten goes up for a tricky overhead, but misses it wide -- 5-4 KASTLES\\n\\nJW: Paes rifles a forehand at Parrott, whose reflex volley lands long -- 6-4 KASTLES\\n\\nBR: On match point, Reynolds comes in behind his serve...and pushes a forehand volley long -- 6-5 KASTLES\\n\\nBR: Witten makes a good return of a first serve and Paes nets a lunging volley -- 6-6\\n\\n\\n\\n20 games all. 6 points all. The entire match came down to a single sudden death point. With receivers\\' choice, the Sportimes opted to have Witten take the return again. He put the ball in play, but was soon at the mercy of flashy veteran Leander Paes. The Indian angled a volley in the direction of Witten, whose desperate reply sailed out. Utterly enraged at the narrow defeat, Witten threw his racquet clear over to the other side of the court. Make it a perfect 12-0 for the Washington Kastles, escaping by the skin of their teeth.\\n\\n\\n\\nFINAL SCORE: KASTLES 21, SPORTIMES 20\\n\\n\\n\\nSerena Williams of the triumphant Kastles looked rather subdued for most of the night, but insists, \"I love playing and I really enjoyed myself out there tonight.\" Assessing her own performance as \"a little off,\" she concluded, \"I made a lot of errors, but came through.\" 11 months off the tour following foot surgery have sent Williams all the way down to 172 in the world rankings, but she aims to rectify that by playing three WTA events before the US Open. \"I\\'m just thinking about my next tournament in Stanford. I have to do a lot of improving.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, a bitter pill to swallow for the Sportimes, whose spirited comeback fell just barely short. I asked Martina Hingis about coming so close against the best team in the league. \"It\\'s coming down to one point, right?\" she replied. \"Plus they had Serena on the team, so hopefully tomorrow (when the teams meet again at Randall\\'s Island) we have another chance. For us, it\\'s big, because if we would have won tonight or tomorrow, we\\'ll make the playoffs. Last chance tomorrow. Win or lose.\" With a twinkle in her eye, Hingis added, \"I prefer winning.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['Bucket List\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 1, 2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were a few things I wanted to accomplish before this year’s US Open concluded. Much as I dislike Arthur Ashe Stadium, I wanted to see what it looks like with the roof closed (italicized hyperlinks refer to photos). I wanted to visit the new Grandstand. And I wanted to see a doubles match from start to finish. Check, check, check – all those things happened on the first Thursday of the tournament.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt a Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, a shareholder once asked whether the company had key man insurance on Warren Buffett’s life. Buffett responded: “We sell insurance, we don’t buy insurance.” Ordinarily, that’s pretty good advice, and certainly if you’re in a position to self-insure. At the US Open, however, now that there is a roof on Ashe and an ever-present threat of rain, the question is whether it’s worth paying an $8 premium for the right to enter a stadium you don’t want to enter. I did so for the Monday and Thursday sessions in the first week, and the insurance policy paid off on Thursday. (It paid off even better for my brother-in-law, who on Wednesday purchased Ashe tickets for Thursday below face value, on StubHub.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt had rained overnight and was still drizzling on Thursday morning. Ashe was the only court in business at the 11:00 a.m. start time, though it was hard to tell by the turnout. As Carl Bialik tweeted: “2 former French Open finalists playing great tennis in front of a stadium 10% full. Maybe everyone’s watching other matches. Oh wait…” The former Roland Garros finalists were Simona Halep (2014) and Lucie Safarova (2015). Halep remains the top ten, while the left-handed Safarova just missed being seeded at the Open. Safarova, sporting Nike’s ubiquitous neon yellow, hits harder than Halep, but Halep is a great defender and was able to fend off many of Safarova’s down-the-line attempts at winners.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe problem for Safarova in this match was that she just could not hold serve. She won only 53% of her first serve points and 32% on second serve, and thus was broken seven times in ten service games. While she recovered from a two-break deficit in the first set to get even at 3-3, she then squandered a 40-15 lead and suffered the decisive break. From there, Halep ran out the set, 6-3, closing it out with a backhand service return winner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSafarova was up an early break in the second set, but Halep broke back for 3-3 and held at love for 4-3. At that juncture, play was underway on the outside courts, and I abandoned the cavernous Ashe. Halep was soon to close out a 6-3 6-4 victory in 87 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI proceeded to Armstrong, where the 2014 finalist Kei Nishikori was taking on Karen Khachanov, a 20-year-old Russian qualifier new to the top hundred. In contrast to Ashe, Armstrong was nearly full. Were savvy Ashe ticketholders scouting out seats during the rain delay, or was there a large influx of holders of grounds passes?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKhachanov, also in Nike’s neon yellow, has a huge forehand, which he used to good effect in pummeling Nishikori’s second serve. (Eventually, Nishikori managed to kick more second serves to Khachanov’s backhand.) At 6’6” (or 1.98 meters), Khachanov pounds his own serve, setting up fairly wide of the center line in both the deuce and ad courts. I have a feeling that his appearance in the top hundred is hardly the last stop on his elevator ride.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKhachanov was up a break in the first set, but he double faulted to let Nishikori tie the set, 3-3. In the tenth game, Khachanov rallied from 0-40 to 30-40, but another double cost him the set. In the second set, Khachanov broke through in the ninth game, crushing a forehand service return to take over the rally on break point, and then serving out the set at love to tie the match.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the eighth game of the third set, Khachanov showed fortitude in recovering from 15-40 and a total of three break points. As Khachanov safely arrived at 4-4, pellets of drizzle turned into real rain, stopping play, and ultimately a downpour. I didn’t see the conclusion of the match, but perhaps Khachanov and Nishikori had too much time to think – Nishikori about how to beat the youngster, Khachanov about the gravity of the situation – during the rain delay. Afterwards, the Japanese veteran took eight of eleven games for a 6-4 4-6 6-4 6-3 win. Though Khachanov did substantial damage on Nishikori’s second serve, the sixth seed eked out 41% of those points; Khachanov, for his part, notched only 33% on second serve. Nishikori produced twice as many break points as Khachanov – 16 versus 8 – and cashed in five, which proved enough for the win.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rain sent me back to Ashe, which filled up substantially now that it was later in the day and the only game in town. Andy Murray had just taken the first set from Marcel Granollers, 6-4. While the latter has reached the fourth round of a major four times (three times at Roland Garros and once at the US Open) and gives the lie to the notion that Spaniards are anchored to the baseline (he came in 34 times and won 22 of those points), he’s just not in Murray’s league. Murray was covering the court very well, and the biggest problem he faced was the noise in Ashe. Not only was the crowd noisy – in my section, a group of bros and their girlfriends were downing beers and conversing loudly throughout play – but the roof holds the sound in. The noise became a “percussive blast,” as the New York Times put it, when the rain turned into a powerful storm. None of this slowed down the lugubrious Scot, who cruised through the second set and got the last break he needed in the ninth game of the third set, the final score being 6-4 6-1 6-4. One cautionary note for Murray: he made only 43% of his first serves. In view of the history of Novak Djokovic abusing Murray’s second serve, the second seed will have to improve that percentage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI then watched a bit of Venus Williams versus Julia Goerges before departing to hit the outside courts again. Williams was up 3-2, on serve, when I left. From there, it was a rout, and she cruised to a 6-2 6-3 victory over Goerges.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy next stop was a first visit to the new Grandstand, where Dominic Thiem, two days before his 23rd birthday, faced the diminutive Ricardas Berankis, who is listed at 5’9” (1.75 meters) but looks shorter. The good news about the new Grandstand is that it is architecturally pleasing and has a large capacity. The bad news: the seats are further from the court than in the old Grandstand (in part because the stadium is round), the entire lower level of seats is reserved, and there is not much shade to be had.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the rain delay, the players were tied in the first set, 4-4. When play resumed, Berankis came out cold and was broken at love. Thiem served out the first set and got only stronger as the match went on. He has powerful groundstrokes on both wings, including an impressive one-handed backhand that he can hit down the line, and can crank up his serve. Almost cruelly, he often opted for a kick serve in the ad court, bouncing the ball above Berankis’s head. There’s nothing wrong with the way Berankis plays, but he just doesn’t have the stature or firepower to compete with a player like Thiem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBerankis had broken Thiem’s serve once, before the rain delay, and that was it for the day. Thiem broke six times and won 47% of return points. To Berankis’s credit, he won 53% of his second serve points. Unfortunately, this means that he won only 53% of his first serve points, too. The final score was 6-4 6-3 6-2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe final item for my bucket list was a doubles match, which came on Court 7 as the doubles specialists Henri Kontinen and John Peers, the tenth-seeded team, faced off against two Argentine southpaws who rank in the top sixty in singles, Federico Delbonis and Guido Pella. I suppose Pella is a hometown boy, now that I’ve seen him represent the New York Empire in World TeamTennis. Kontinen and Peers had reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon this year, and Kontinen won the mixed with Heather Watson. He was more effective than Peers in this match, albeit with the same limitation that I had noticed (on television, not in person) in the mixed doubles final at Wimbledon: his one-handed backhand can be a forcing shot, but he misses off that wing way too often. On the plus side, Kontinen has a big serve and patrols the forecourt with élan, achieving sharp angles on the volley because of his proximity to the net. Each of the Argentines, as one might expect of South American players these days, stayed back on his serve; Kontinen and Peers played in the classic mode of following serve to net, albeit often employing the I formation to try to protect Peers’s serve. Delbonis has a remarkable hitch in his service motion, bringing the ball up to toss it, pausing, and then completing the toss. It is almost as though the ball is too heavy for him to toss it above his head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStarting the match, Peers and then Delbonis held serve with difficulty, and then both teams held routinely until the tiebreak. Kontinen and Peers pounced when Delbonis missed his first serve at 1-1 in the tiebreak, taking over the net and eliciting a lob that sailed long. With Pella serving at 2-4, Delbonis knocked a volley long. Those two mini-breaks were all that were necessary, as Kontinen and Peers cashed in all their service points and won the tiebreak easily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second set was quite another story, as the Argentine team broke Peers twice to lead 5-1. Delbonis could not serve out the set and then Kontinen held serve in a multi-deuce game, but Pella took care of business in the ninth game. At 30-30, he nailed Peers with a backhand volley, and the Aussie was down for a while. I thought he had been hit in the stomach, but in light of the length of time he spent on the ground, maybe not. At any rate, Peers was able to go on, and Pella closed out the set with a backhand passing shot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThough doubles must be serious business for Kontinen and Peers, since they’re not making any money in singles, there is a lighter atmosphere in doubles matches. As sunset approached, photographers gathered on the top row of Court 7 to take their artistic shots.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the deciding set, Pella served at 0-1 and was broken at love. Later, he saved three break points at 1-4, but Peers and Kontinen served out the match without incident, the Aussie holding at love and the Finn at 15. The final score was 7-6(2) 3-6 6-3. The Argentines were actually stronger on second serve than on first, winning 69% of their second serve points as compared to 63% on first serve. Kontinen and Peers, who were playing serve-and-volley, depended more on the first serve, and their figures were 79% on first serve and 51% on second.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI had checked off the bucket list, but that did not mean I was finished for the day. I headed to the old Grandstand, where Jeremy Chardy was up a set on Grigor Dimitrov and serving at 4-5 in the second. Chardy quickly fell behind 0-40 and was broken at 15, so the match was tied. Both players have abundant natural talent and style to spare, but Dimitrov, as shaky as he has been of late, has had more success, topping out at number 8 in the world, versus Chardy’s high of 25. Dimitrov, moreover, is still 25, while Chardy is 29 (and showing a touch of gray in his beard).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA few drops of rain fell during the third set, but play continued. Chardy broke at love in the seventh game, capped by a Dimitrov double fault. With Dimitrov serving at 3-5, another double fault (each player would serve eight) made it 30-40, and then he netted a backhand for a second break and the set.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRather than wilting, Dimitrov immediately broke serve to start the fourth set and added a second break for a 4-1 lead. Chardy broke back and held for 3-4. Dimitrov had a tough hold to get to 5-3 but then an easy one to close out the set, so the match would go the distance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDimitrov kept rolling, breaking at love to start the fifth set, helped by a net cord winner on the opening point and gifted with a double fault on the fourth. As in the fourth set, Dimitrov went up a second break, and this time there was no letup. Chardy seemed exhausted, mentally if not physically, as evidenced by a forehand he hit between his legs (unsuccessfully) in the fifth game, as he couldn’t get out of the way of the ball. Though Chardy got on the board, holding serve for 1-4, Dimitrov stayed the course, closing out the match in 3 hours and 5 minutes, 4-6 6-4 3-6 6-4 6-2. On this night, at least, he looked like a mature player who can (and should) be a factor in major championships.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the match ended and the players hugged, at 10:47 p.m., there were still four singles matches underway on the grounds. (The night session ended just about when Dimitrov had won.) I was tempted to stay, but out of deference to my other responsibilities I headed home, looking forward to one more day at the Open: Monday, when my ticket is in Armstrong, leaving me in Warren Buffett’s no-insurance mode.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['Like Finding a $20 Bill\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 9, 2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn another steamy day at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, I hid out in the American Express Fan Experience for some air conditioning before facing the heat. The facility featured a display case from the International Tennis Hall of Fame, which included a memorable Rosie Casals dress designed by Ted Tinling. It was a long way from today’s Nike and adidas gear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter projecting a bright future for Reilly Opelka, I felt compelled to see him again, this time on Court 11 against the eleventh seed, Yunseong Chung of South Korea. The diminutive Chung, who will not turn 18 until next March, is listed, perhaps generously, at 5’10” and 165 pounds. Earlier this year, he had reached the second round of the Australian Open juniors, the round of 16 at Roland Garros, and the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. Perhaps more impressive, at a Challenger event earlier this year, he lost narrowly to Mikhail Kukushkin, 7-5 6-4, the same Kukushkin who defeated Grigor Dimitrov and took Marin Cilic to five sets in this year�s Open.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChung blunted Opelka’s power brilliantly and made me rethink the American’s potential. Against a player who can return his serve, Opelka still has a long way to go. Opelka would also benefit from eliminating some sloppiness in his game — not just the groundstrokes that go awry, of which there were far more against Chung than in the first-round match against Alejandro Tabilo, but also mistakes that are easier to address: two foot faults in the Tabilo match and another two against Chung.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOpelka served 12 aces, most of them coming not on his boomers, but rather on slices in the deuce court and kick serves in the ad court, which were simply out of Chung’s reach. The effectiveness of these serves is enhanced by deception: Opelka’s toss is consistently above his left shoulder, so it is difficult to read where he is going. But when Chung was able to get a racquet on the ball, he was not intimidated by Opelka’s speed, and returned with authority.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the third game, while his father watched from a shaded nook in the stands, Opelka saved three break points, but he was back in the soup on his next service game, falling behind 15-40 and then double-faulting. That was all Chung needed, as he served out the set, 6-4, consistently winning the longer points. In the second set, neither player got to break point. (Opelka didn’t get to break point all day.) Opelka was losing patience, muttering “What is wrong with me?” after giving away a point when Chung was serving at 15-30 in the sixth game, and then filibustering the umpire after missing a volley in the seventh game, arguing that Chung had failed to hit the prior shot before the second bounce.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nServing at 1-2 in the tiebreak, Opelka dropped both service points on errant groundstrokes. Chung held the lead, getting to match point with a great forehand passing shot down the line and then putting away a short forehand to clinch the victory, 6-4 7-6(2).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo what do I think of Opelka’s upside now? With the usual provisos for small sample size, he seemed to distinguish himself from John Isner far less when he played Chung than when he had played Tabilo. Withal, Isner has made it into the top twenty with a big serve, a decent forehand, and not much else, and Opelka already has those tools in his kit. At 6’10”, Opelka has a natural advantage on serve — and, as Red Auerbach supposedly said, you can’t teach height. I still see a top fifty future for Opelka, but now I’m hesitant to say much more. As for Chung, there’s a lot to like in his game, not just the groundstrokes, but also the occasional serve that he thumps. If he still has another couple of inches of growth ahead of him, he may make some noise on the tour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter a break in the Chase Lounge to cool off and eat lunch, I continued to Armstrong to see the unseeded teams of Steve Johnson/Sam Querrey and Leonardo Mayer/Joao Sousa (of Portugal, not to be confused with Joao Souza of Brazil) in a doubles quarterfinal. Johnson came in behind almost every first serve and many second serves; the other three players mostly stayed back. It’s also important to acknowledge the old-school players with one-handed backhands, and Mayer is one such.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were no reserved seats in Armstrong on Wednesday, leaving plenty of good seats available behind the court, but who wanted to sit in the sun? I hid out in the shade to the right of the TV booth, high above the court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe American team won routinely, with one break of Mayer in each set, 6-3 6-4. Querrey, whose singles career has settled into mediocrity, is now in the semifinals of the men’s doubles and (with Bethanie Mattek-Sands) the finals of the mixed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy next stop was the regrettable Ashe, where a loud coterie of fans who called themselves Halepeños were rooting on Simona Halep against the hard-hitting Victoria Azarenka. The loudest of the crew was shouting after every point, fortunately in a language other than English, because who knows what might have happened had everyone understood him?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe entrances to the stadium were like wind tunnels, but there was nary a breeze inside the stifling arena. When I arrived, Azarenka was serving at 3-6 2-0. Halep got back on serve in the fifth game, Azarenka jumped ahead 4-2, Halep broke when Azarenka served for the set, and then Azarenka broke back on an errant Halep backhand to tie the match.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe players took advantage of the heat rule applicable to the women’s singles to take a ten-minute break after the second set. In the third set, Azarenka saved three break points in the opening game and broke in the second game to take a 2-0 lead. On her fourth break point in the third game, Halep broke back. She was serving at 1-2 30-15 when the ballboys were summoned to towel the baselines dry. That’s never a good sign on a hard court: Halep won the next point to go up 40-15, and then play was stopped for rain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRumors were flying that the match I really wanted to see, the quarterfinal between Stan Wawrinka and Kevin Anderson, would be moved from Ashe (where it was scheduled to be the last match of the day session) to Armstrong, in order to avoid bumping up against the Federer-Gasquet night match. The imperative for the move was the expectation that it would rain again at night, so the night session needed to start on time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the rains came, I made the best decision of the day: to head to Armstrong for the potential Wawrinka-Anderson match. If the match were moved, I had a chance for a great seat — recall that there were no reserved seats on Armstrong on Wednesday — and if not I could always return to Ashe. Good news came shortly after 5:00 p.m., when the doubles net on Armstrong was replaced with a singles net. The Wawrinka-Anderson match would not get started till 6:30, a mystery in its own right, as the process of drying the court with Zamboni machines went pretty quickly, but now I knew I was golden. Fans began to stream into Armstrong about twenty minutes later (and Halep outlasted Azarenka in Ashe), but I had secured a front-row seat behind the court. Not far away, in a corner box, were Wawrinka’s coach, Magnus Norman, and his now-famous girlfriend, Donna Vekic (in the gray top with an orange sweater draped over her shoulders). As between sitting in the nosebleed seats in Ashe or watching this match from the front row of Armstrong — albeit with the risk of getting thumped by one of Anderson’s high, hard serves — the benefits of the rain delay were obvious. It felt, indeed, like finding a $20 bill on the street.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWawrinka, hard as this would have been to imagine a few years ago, is a future Hall of Famer. Still, the players had faced off four times in the last two seasons, and Anderson had won all four (after Wawrinka had won the first three meetings of their careers). And now Anderson, who wears white ankle braces that are not easily seen on television, was coming off a career-defining victory over Andy Murray for his first trip to a major quarterfinal. Still, there were good reasons for skepticism that he was becoming a top ten player.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat skepticism was borne out when Wawrinka gave a 107-minute tennis clinic. The world knows about Stan’s gorgeous one-handed backhand, which he nailed down the line a few times in almost supernatural fashion. Wawrinka won the match, however, not so much with flash as with a plan: against the 6’8” Anderson, he kept the ball low, frequently using a slice backhand to extract weak replies and errors. Wawrinka also took very good care of his serve, facing only one break point all match, which he saved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first break came at 3-3, on an Anderson double fault, when Anderson missed his first serve on all five points of the game. It was in the next game that Wawrinka faced his only break point, which he saved with a crosscourt backhand pass. With Wawrinka serving at set point, the wind kicked up just as he threw in an off-speed (100 mph) first serve, and Anderson couldn’t handle it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the second set, the break came with Anderson serving at 4-4. The big man served and volleyed at 15-40, only to be victimized by one of Wawrinka’s superb down-the-line backhands. Wawrinka finished the set with a flourish, on a serve-and-volley point of his own.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the third set, Anderson was spent. At 30-40 in the first game, he double faulted for the break. Two double faults followed in the third game, including one at 15-40. In the fifth game, Anderson came in behind serve at 30-30, only to watch Wawrinka’s forehand return pass him down the line, and then the South African was long with a backhand approach for a third break of serve. The Swiss number 2 then finished off the third set with a bagel, the last two points coming on rare Wawrinka serve-and-volley forays. Afterward, Wawrinka told his interviewer that he was happy to play on Armstrong because of the atmosphere, and he tossed towels and other paraphernalia to begging fans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs is often the case, second serve was a key to the match: Wawrinka won 68% of his second serve points, while Anderson could muster only 37%. Wawrinka was tougher on first serve, too, a remarkable 94% versus Anderson’s 70%. Wawrinka made only 48% of his first serves, but on this night it did not matter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter Wawrinka’s 6-4 6-4 6-0 victory, I ended the day as I had begun it, watching Yunseong Chung. This time, he was playing doubles on Court 13 as part of the third-seeded team, joined by fellow Korean Seong-chang Hong. They faced the Slovak-Czech team of Lukas Klein and Patrik Rikl. I suspected, and later confirmed, that Patrik Rikl is a son of the retired doubles specialist David Rikl.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn instructor with what I took to be an Australian accent exhorted the Koreans with repeated chants of “C’mon, boys.” He addressed Hong as “Hongy,” which might or might not have gone over well. The boys were not coming on, however. When I arrived, the Klein/Rikl team was leading 7-5 3-2, and they would break to give Klein a chance to serve for the match at 5-2. He was broken, however, and then Rikl was broken on the next try after holding a match point. With Hong serving at 5-5 30-40, however, Chung, who was in the I formation at the net, hit a volley that danced along the net cord and fell back on his side. On the unseeded team’s third try to serve out the match, Klein held at 15 for a 7-5 7-5 win.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThus concluded my 2015 at the US Open, with nary a visit to the Grandstand. The good news I heard on Wednesday, from one of the ushers, was that the old Grandstand would remain standing next year, notwithstanding the expected completion of its replacement, to be held in reserve. Let’s hope the old Grandstand will still be used, and I won’t let another year slip by without a visit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['Report from the First Week of the BNP Paribas in Indian Wells\\n\\nby James Handal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first week of the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in Indian Wells has been an exciting week. Many of the top tennis players are still in the draw. America\\'s up and coming Donald Young, a qualifier, defeated Britain\\'s Andy Murray, ranked # 5 in the world, while last year\\'s defending champion Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia fell to Argentina\\'s Juan Martin Del Potro. Canada\\'s Milos Raonic upset America\\'s Mardy Fish, while top players Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Andy Roddick, John Isner and local Santa Monica resident Sam Querrey still compete for the title. On the women\\'s side, second seed Kim Clijsters is moving ahead and is a crowd favorite.\\n\\n\\n\\nMany special events including Kids Day, the National 9/11 Flag Display, and Salute to Heroes occurred during the first week. \"Rally, Round-up, Recycle,\" a new program designed to recycle tennis balls, collected more than 100,000 tennis balls the first weekend. There are still more activities for fans during the final weekend of the tournament, March 19 and March 20.\\n\\n\\n\\nMalibu\\'s Larry Ellison, owner of the BNP Paribas Open and the Malibu Racquet Club, could be spotted courtside in the first row watching Nadal and Federer. This year, he made a lot of great changes to the tournament. In addition to all of the match courts having Hawk-eye replay technology which allows players to challenge line calls, there are electronic boards which show when designated players are practicing, so fans can try to get autographs. Two clay courts were removed to make room for four additional practice courts and a new food and drink area called Plaza de Corona is centered in the middle of the grounds so fans can stop there and watch video displays of live matches.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Bryan Brothers, whose recent fundraiser at the Malibu Racquet Club raised money for the Bogart Pediatric Cancer Care Center at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, are seeded #1 in mens\\' doubles and hope to take the title.

       " ['Ailing Sportimes and Freedoms Do Battle in Albany\\n\\nby Christopher Gerby\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing a much ballyhooed season opener featuring star attraction Andy Roddick, the New York Sportimes were due for a bit of a letdown as they returned to action in Albany on Friday night. Attendance was relatively sparse and none of the local newspapers sent a reporter (leaving yours truly as the evening\\'s scribe of record). Understandably, World TeamTennis devotes heavy promotion to big names like Roddick who make select appearances during the season, but lower profile matches like this one count just as much in the standings.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdding injury to insult, both the 2-2 Sportimes and 0-3 Philadelphia Freedoms came in banged up. Would-be everyday women\\'s singles player Jessica Pegula and marquee player Sloane Stephens withdrew from World TeamTennis shortly before the season began, forcing the Freedoms to scramble. After Maria Sanchez (for two matches) and Alison Riske (for one) filled in on an emergency basis, the Freedoms tabbed 17-year-old Team Tennis rookie Victoria Duval to shoulder the women\\'s singles load for the rest of the season. Meanwhile, Kevta Peschke of the Sportimes is playing at less than 100% and Robert Kendrick isn\\'t playing at all, temporarily out of the lineup with an injury of his own. Kentucky native (and five-time All-American at the University of Kentucky) Eric Quigley flew in to take Kendrick\\'s place...and was pressed into duty in the night\\'s opening event.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst set: men\\'s doubles -- Quigley/Witten vs. Groth/Kerr\\n\\n\\n\\nEric Quigley made a good early impression in his WTT debut, digging out of a 15-40 hole (hitting an ace along the way) to hold serve in the opening game. However, his partner Jesse Witten wasn\\'t as fortunate, dropping serve as Sam Groth knifed away a volley to break for a 2-1 Philadelphia lead. Groth and fellow Aussie Jordan Kerr quickly consolidated the break and extended their edge to 4-2.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother rough service game for Witten put the Sportimes on the brink of relative disaster, already facing a pair of set points in Game 7. But Witten saved the first with an ace and Quigley staved off the second with a winning backhand volley. As Quigley raised a clenched fist and grinned broadly, you could sense the brand new doubles partnership starting to gel. Alas, the fast paced format of World TeamTennis leaves little room for an adustment period. Quigley and Witten failed to put many returns in play as Jordan Kerr decisively served out the Freedoms\\' 5-3 victory.\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: FREEDOMS 5, SPORTIMES 3\\n\\n\\n\\nEric Quigley hadn\\'t made his Sportimes debut under ideal circumstances. \"He just got in today. We had to find a sub last minute. He landed at 3 o\\'clock,\" Jesse Witten told me after the match.\" Far from throwing his fill-in partner under the bus, Witten added, \"He played great! I didn\\'t serve my best today, had a little trouble. We had our chances.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSecond set: women\\'s singles -- Anna-Lena Groenefeld vs. Victoria Duval\\n\\n\\n\\nYouth versus experience was the theme in set two. Though she\\'s now a doubles specialist, 28-year-old Anna-Lena Groenefeld has a WTA Tour singles title to her credit and a career high ranking of 14th in the world. 17-year-old Victoria Duval, meanwhile, is just getting her feet wet. Her greatest claim to fame was winning the USTA 18-and-Under Nationals last summer. That earned her wild card entry into the US Open, where she became the last player to lose to a retirement-bound Kim Clijsters.\\n\\n\\n\\nMuch as it had in her previous home match on Tuesday, Groenefeld\\'s serve was giving her all kinds of difficulty. Two double faults in the opening game practically handed a break to Duval on a silver platter. Nevertheless, once she managed to put the ball in play, Groenefeld was clearly dictating the action, pinning Duval behind the baseline with punishing groundstrokes. Groenefeld would reel off four consecutive games, making Duval look every bit the World TeamTennis debutante.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Duval sprayed a particularly wild forehand error early in Game 6, it appeared the ending would be swift and inevitable. Undaunted, Liezel Huber let out an encouraging cry of \"Come on, Vicky!\" from the Freedoms bench. And when Duval battled her way to game point, the Freedoms called a timeout, sending Samuel Groth out to counsel the young American. Whatever he said must have done the trick -- Duval laced a forehand winner down the line to hold for 2-4.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Duval claimed a service break, narrowing the margin to 3-4, the Freedoms rose to their feet in unison. Liezel Huber even broke into an impromptu dance. Across the way, Groenefeld slammed a ball in anger. The Freedoms continued bouncing on their toes in front of the Philly bench throughout Game 8, while Groenefeld\\'s teammates remained seated and stoic. An inspired Duval held at love, taking some serious momentum into the set-deciding tiebreak...\\n\\n\\n\\nALG serving: Groenefeld buries a forehand in the net -- 1-0 FREEDOMS\\n\\nALG: Groenefeld\\'s forehand clips the tape and flutters wide -- 2-0 FREEDOMS\\n\\nVD: Groenefeld snaps her 8-point losing streak, ending a good rally with a forheand winner -- 2-1 FREEDOMS\\n\\nVD: Backhand winner down the line for Groenefeld -- 2-2\\n\\nALG: A point finally goes with serve as Duval\\'s backhand is just long -- 3-2 SPORTIMES\\n\\nALG: Duval catches the baseline with a clutch forehand -- 3-3\\n\\nVD: Duval earns a set point by a lacing a cross-court backhand into the corner -- 4-3 FREEDOMS\\n\\nVD: Groenefeld sends a forehand long to end it -- 5-3 SPORTIMES\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon completing her comeback from a 1-4 deficit, Victoria Duval was immediately mobbed by giddy teammates. She\\'d been overpowered and seemingly outclassed in the first half of the set, but steadied her nerves and turned the tide with a little help from her new friends.\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: FREEDOMS 10, SPORTIMES 7\\n\\n\\n\\nThird set: men\\'s singles -- Jesse Witten vs. Samuel Groth\\n\\n\\n\\n\"THWACK!\" There\\'s a distinctive sound made when Sam Groth unleashes a first serve. It\\'s a miniature sonic boom, amplified when he\\'s playing indoors. The Aussie may not be a household name, but that rocket of a serve has made tennis history. Playing at a challenger event in Busan last year, Groth had a serve measured at an eye-popping 163.4 miles per hour, shattering Ivo Karlovic\\'s previous record by more than seven MPH. Whether or not you trust the radar guns used in South Korea, there\\'s no denying Groth\\'s serve is a thing of beauty and raw power. (For the record, the ATP Tour confirmed that the Busan challenger \"was using approved equipment\" and that \"other data gathered appeared within a normal range.\")\\n\\n\\n\\nUnsurprisingly. Groth recorded aces in each of his first two service games. He also pulled off one nifty behind-the-back shot, but couldn\\'t make much of an impression in his first two return games. (Jesse Witten\\'s serve, it must be noted, is no slouch.) As they switched sides, the Melbourne native looked plenty relaxed...and just to make him feel even more at a home, the arena DJ played a slice of Men at Work\\'s \"Down Under\" during the changeover.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter Witten held for 3-2, Groth resumed his laser show. Ace for 30-0. Ace for 40-0. \"Jesse, wear a helmet!\" one fan quipped as an exasperated Witten backed all the way up to the fence to return Groth\\'s next delivery. He did get the return in play this time, but Groth cleverly executed a drop shot. Making a hopeless dash from the back of the court, Witten chuckled and gave his opponent a thumbs up as the ball bounced twice.\\n\\n\\n\\nGame 7 produced, at long last, a pair of break points. Witten came up with a pair of first serves when he needed them, however, and nosed back ahead at 4-3. Just as quickly as Groth had seemed to be in the ascendancy, the pendulum swung back. Groth opened Game 8 with back-to-back double faults and groaned \"come on\" when an errant forehand gave Witten quadruple set point at 0-40. Groth staved off the first break chance, but faltered on the second, steering a backhand wide. The vaunted Groth serve having proved slightly vulernable after all, Witten capped his 5-3 victory with a celebratory fist pump.\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: FREEDOMS 13, SPORTIMES 12\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the match, I asked Witten where Groth\\'s serve ranks among the biggest he\\'s faced. \"He\\'s got the record, right? Isn\\'t it the biggest? It\\'s the biggest to me. It\\'s a tough serve. If he\\'s hittin\\' it in, you can\\'t do anything. You\\'ve gotta guess and just try to make a couple plays, get lucky.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFourth set: mixed doubles -- Groenefeld/Witten vs. Huber/Groth\\n\\n\\n\\nIf revenge was on Samuel Groth\\'s mind, he didn\\'t have long to wait. Set 4 saw Groth and Witten throwing howitzers at each other all over again. This time it was Witten who blinked first. With the Freedoms up 1-0, 30-30, Witten missed one volley, then gagged another on break point. Jesse launched a ball far into the unoccupied upper reaches of the stands, incurring a \"ball abuse\" warning for his trouble.\\n\\n\\n\\n7-time Grand Slam doubles champion Liezel Huber tacked on a love hold and the Freedoms were off to the races. Another mighty Groth ace clinched Game 5, giving Philadelphia a 4-1 lead in the set and a 17-13 advantage overall. Witten continued to come unglued, casting a suspcious glance at the overhead lights after double faulting early in Game 6. After squadering set points in singles, Groth needed only one here. The Aussie spanked a winning backhand overhead, breaking Witten\\'s serve and securing a 5-1 win after just 17 minutes of mixed doubles.\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: FREEDOMS 18, SPORTIMES 13\\n\\n\\n\\nFifth set: women\\'s doubles -- Groenefeld/Peschke vs. Duval/Huber\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Freedom\\'s just another word for nothing left to lose\"...and trailing the Freedoms by 5 games meant Anna-Lena Groenefeld and Kveta Peschke had little to lose as they ran the anchor leg for New York. The reigning Brussels Open doubles champions came out swinging from the hips against the first-time pairing of Victoria Duval and Liezel Huber. Groenefeld raised a defiant fist after holding for 1-0. Huber was swiftly broken for 2-0 and Peschke tacked on a comfortable hold for 3-0. Since there\\'s no running out the clock in tennis (particularly in WTT, where you must win the final game, no matter how badly your opponents are trailing in the overall score), the hearty Sportime supporters still in attendance had reason to get excited.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne fan in particular was a bit too excited, letting out a distracting whistle every time Huber or Duval served. This raised the considerable ire of Samuel Groth, who repeatedly voiced his displeasure to the umpire. \"Every time! If he does it again, I\\'m gonna jump the fence,\" Groth finally theatened. Looking in the offending spectactor\\'s direction, Groth grumbled, \"Good one, mate. Good sport.\" I should mention here that Groth stands nearly 6 foot 5 and actually played in the rough and tumble world of professional Australian Rules Football two years ago. He is one big dude not to be trifled with, so it came as little surprise when his \"jump the fence\" vow caused the whistling to cease.\\n\\n\\n\\nPeace and quiet having been restored, Duval got the Freedoms on the board with a hold for 1-3. A surging Groenefeld blasted through a love hold for 4-1, however, putting the pressure squarely on 36-year-old WTT stalwart Liezel Huber. Already trailing 0-30, Huber saw her serve clip the tape and hop into the service box. Under Team Tennis rules, that\\'s a live ball, eligible to be struck by either player on the returning team. Making a great heads up play, Groenefeld (who wasn\\'t even the intended returner) swooped in and spanked a winning forehand. Two points later, the German put away a high forehand volley to wrap up the set.\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: FREEDOMS 19, SPORTIMES 18\\n\\n\\n\\nVirtual bedlam in the SEFCU Arena as Groenefeld and Peschke\\'s 5-1 triumph sent the match into overtime. If the Freedoms could break Kveta Peschke\\'s serve, they\\'d survive and win the match. If Peschke held, we\\'d go into a first-to-7-points supertiebreaker. Peschke wavered slightly, issuing a double fault at 40-30. The no-ad scoring meant it was now game point for the Sportimes and match point for the Freedoms. The Czech put in a good first serve this time, then watched her partner claim the game with a nifty drop volley. Looking so much more comfortable in doubles than she had in her singles loss, Anna-Lena Groenefeld vigorously shook her fist.\\n\\n\\n\\nOVERALL SCORE: SPORTIMES 19, FREEDOMS 19\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Freedoms were reeling, on the ropes, and in seemingly dire straits against the top ranked women\\'s doubles team in the league. Veteran Liezel Huber and rookie Victoria Duval would need to get their act together in a hurry as the suddenly very dramatic match entered its final chapter: the Supertiebreaker.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVD serving: Groenefeld nets a low forehand volley -- 1-0 FREEDOMS\\n\\nVD: Huber shows off her considerable doubles chops on a winning backhand volley -- 2-0 FREEDOMS\\n\\nALG: Groenefeld badly mis-hits a forehand wide -- 3-0 FREEDOMS\\n\\nALG: Peschke weakly dumps a high backhand volley into the net; the Sportimes call timeout -- 4-0 FREEDOMS\\n\\nLH: Peschke\\'s backhand return is barely wide; her imploring look to the umpire yields no overrule -- 5-0 FREEDOMS\\n\\nLH: Groenefeld nets her forehand return, giving Philly a gaggle of match points -- 6-0 FREEDOMS\\n\\nKP: Peschke staves off elimination with a forehand winner -- 6-1 FREEDOMS\\n\\nKP: Swinging forehand volley by Peschke flies long to end it -- 7-1 FREEDOMS\\n\\n\\n\\nFINAL SCORE: FREEDOMS 20, SPORTIMES 19\\n\\n\\n\\nA stunning reversal of fortune as Groenefeld and Peschke, who\\'d led such a furious comeback, were summarily trounced at the final hurdle. After the match, Jesse Witten had nothing but praise for the vaunted women\\'s doubles duo. \"That\\'s the team we want out there. They showed that they\\'re the best team, they\\'re the best doubles team. I guess we put \\'em in a tough spot to have to win six games AND a tiebreaker. They did a great job. It is a little disappointing, because we definitely had the momentum and right where we wanted to be.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, the spectre of injuries hangs over the Sportimes. \"We\\'re a little banged up,\" Witten admits. \"We\\'ve got Kveta hurt and Rob hurt. We\\'re trying to get healthier. We\\'ve got a couple days off. It\\'s a loss, but we\\'ve got a lot more left.\" And the cavalry arrives on Monday, as former number 4 player in the world James Blake makes a newly scheduled appearance in the New York lineup. \"That should help out, hopefully help out our injuries. If he can get us healthy, he can play all the time,\" says Witten. \"I know James a little bit. I\\'ve practiced with him a bunch. Great guy, good teammate. We\\'re happy to have him come fill in for us and try to get some more fans out here. We\\'re looking forward to it. I think it\\'ll be a good match and maybe he\\'ll be the key to our success.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['A Return to Forest Hills Stadium\\n\\n\\n\\nJuly 31, 2016\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first question about this dispatch has to be: What are you doing watching World TeamTennis? I’ve been opposed to the format since its inception, for two reasons. First, it’s more like an exhibition than a serious event. Second, and even more important, it detracts from the main tour – or at least it did when WTT ran for a longer period on the calendar. (In 1974, Jimmy Connors was barred from Roland Garros for signing a contract with WTT.) Now, the WTT season is much shorter (12 contests per season versus the original 44) and there’s less of a main tour to detract from, at least in the United States. By way of comparison, I looked at the tournaments on the men’s main tour, then known as the Grand Prix, in the United States in 1978, which was the final year of the original version of World Team Tennis (back when “Team” and “Tennis” were separate words). The list is so long as to be almost incomprehensible today:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Birmingham\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Boca Raton\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Baltimore\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Philadelphia\\n\\n\\n\\n5.

US Open\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPart of this is the shrinking of the tour worldwide – the ATP is now down to 62 tournaments per year, as opposed to the 96 in 1978. Another part is the decreased popularity of tennis in the US. In 1978, eleven of the year-end top twenty were Americans: Connors, John McEnroe, Gerulaitis, Dibbs, Gottfried, Solomon, Tanner, Ashe, Sandy Mayer, Tim Gullikson, and Stockton. At this writing, John Isner, at number 17, is the only American in the top twenty (and, as it happens, he is playing WTT this summer). Small wonder that over half the ATP events this year are in Europe.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis lengthy exegesis is meant to provide justification, at least to the satisfaction of its author, for supporting an enterprise of questionable value. That the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills is a short subway ride away from my home does not hurt, either. While I would be happier to attend a Challenger event at Forest Hills – and there was such an event from 2003 to 2007 – WTT was on offer now, and I succumbed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForest Hills Stadium (italicized hyperlinks lead to photographs) has deteriorated over the years, its rise and fall chronicled here and here. It’s not in great condition today, but presumably it’s no longer a “hard-hat area,” and the Empire has installed seats with backs near the court, which are far more comfortable than the stadium’s old bleachers. On the opposite side of the court is the stage for the stadium’s concerts, repurposed as seating with tables, and the West Side Tennis Club’s neo-Tudor clubhouse is visible in the background. There are four portraits under the stands, of Guillermo Vilas, Arthur Ashe, Billie Jean King, and John McEnroe. It had been many years since I’d been at the stadium, and I’d forgotten how small it is, but the demand for US Open tickets, even during a spike of popularity for tennis in the 1970s, was not what it is today.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore the match began, there was an opening ceremony featuring the commissioner of WTT, Ilana Kloss, and a tribute to Billie Jean King and Virginia Wade, as well as a visit from New York City’s former mayor David Dinkins (who is four years younger than the stadium) and the national anthem from Sydney James Harcourt, who now plays Aaron Burr in Hamilton.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe current iteration of WTT has only six teams playing a two-week schedule (plus the final just before the US Open): the New York Empire, a new franchise, as well as the Orange County Breakers, Philadelphia Freedoms, San Diego Avatars, Springfield Lasers, and Washington Kastles. The match I attended was between the Empire and the Kastles. (Why are they called the Kastles? I have learned that that’s the name of the business owned by the team’s owner, Mark Ein. This also explains why there was a man on the Kastles’ bench who did not look like a player and had “EIN” on the back of his shirt. Had I known, I would have got a better photo of him than this one.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo one seems to take WTT all that seriously: for the first match in Empire franchise history, the coach, Patrick McEnroe, had other obligations at the Rogers Cup, and Katrina Adams, president of the USTA, substituted for him. (That the president of the national federation would participate in a WTT match shows how innocuous the league has become.) The Empire’s roster nominally includes Andy Roddick, Noah Rubin, and Daniel Nguyen, none of whom were present for the July 31 match. Instead, their players were Maria Irigoyen, Christina McHale, Guido Pella, Neal Skupski, and Taylor Townsend, who does not show up on the league’s website and never removed her warmups at this match. (The Wall Street Journal has reported that Roddick, a part owner of WTT, will play two matches for the Empire.) If Townsend remains on the team, there will be some irony in her being coached by McEnroe, who in 2012 was involved in the decision to cut her USTA funding until she lost weight. Notwithstanding valid concerns about body image and eating disorders, the USTA had a point. Townsend is 20 now and, despite her talent, mired at number 146 in the world. There’s no diplomatic way to say it: she does not look like she is in shape to play world-class tennis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Kastles in attendance were Coach Murphy Jensen, Madison Brengle, Martina Hingis, Denis Kudla, Leander Paes (at 43, old enough to have been alive when the US Open was last played at Forest Hills), and Anastasia Rodionova. The unseen members of the roster were Bob and Mike Bryan, Mardy Fish, Nick Kyrgios, Sam Querrey, and Sam Groth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWTT can’t resist gimmicks, which included some of the players wearing cameras on their heads during warmups (see McHale and Kudla) and the obligatory ear-splitting music in the background. (After the start of play, the volume of music played during breaks was moderated.) Everything is designed for speed: no-ad scoring, serves that touch the net cord are in play, changeovers only after four games, sets won by the first player to 5 games, and 9-point tiebreaks at 4-4. There is a “halftime” after the first three sets, and the final set of the evening was held up after a changeover while we waited for a television commercial break to end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe night opened with men’s doubles between Paes/Kudla and Skupski/Pella. Each team was broken once and the set went to a tiebreak, at which point Paes seemed to shed 20 years. He led his team to a 4-0 lead and they claimed the tiebreak, 5-1.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHingis/Rodionova and McHale/Irigoyen followed in women’s doubles. In another WTT gimmick, the teammates warmed up on opposite sides of the net, as Hingis hit with Rodionova and McHale with Irigoyen. It was as though WTT wanted to make a statement: “We’re warriors. We can’t warm up with our opponents.” Hingis served out the set for a 5-2 win, saving three break points from 1-3. She remains a breed apart: all the other players wore their last names on their backs, but not she, as if to say, “If you have to ask who I am, you don’t belong here.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Empire drew to within 12-11 when Pella took the men’s singles from Kudla, 5-2. Kudla was as high as 53rd in the ATP rankings this May, but now he’s at number 120. He’s listed at 5’11” and may be shorter than that, but he is a hard hitter. Pella, a lefty now nestled in the top 50, had entered the top 40 in March, and he made Roger Federer play two tiebreaks in the first round of Wimbledon this year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProbably the most important point of the evening came in the mixed doubles. The Kastles’ team of Hingis/Paes served for the set, leading 4-2 3-3 over the Empire’s McHale/Skupski. The cumulative score for the match was 16-13. Hingis missed her first serve. If McHale could return the second serve effectively (the mixed doubles rule being that return of serve on 3-3 deciding points belongs to the player of the same gender as the server), the Empire could draw to within 16-14 and still be alive in the mixed doubles set. But she netted her return, giving the Kastles the set and an overall lead of 17-13.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter that, the women’s singles set between McHale – 58th in the world and Serena Williams’s most difficult opponent at Wimbledon this year – and Brengle, currently 50th in the rankings, was something of an anticlimax. McHale arguably has more game than Brengle, but often faltered after establishing a lead in the point. With two breaks of serve, Brengle took a 3-0 lead, and she eventually closed out the set, 5-2, giving Washington a 22-15 victory. The local fans did not seem too bent out of shape by the home team’s defeat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe good news about WTT is that the players are on salary and all seemed pretty happy and free of stress. This is also the bad news about WTT, because it means that the stakes are low and play is not on the highest level. But I don’t think the ATP tour is returning to South Orange, so this will have to do. If it means a payday for a few more players without disrupting the main tour, I can’t object, any more than I do to the Bundesliga.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['End of Summer\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 3, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a bittersweet element to the US Open. On Labor Day weekend, it seems like the whole world descends upon the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. After Labor Day (for non-US readers, that coincides with the second Monday of the tournament), the crowds thin out until the culmination of the tournament, and even then they are almost all packed into Ashe. And then, in the blink of an eye, another summer is gone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt age 18, Denis Shapovalov is probably not too wistful about the end of summer. He’s in a hurry chasing tennis balls, ranking points, and, incidentally, dollars. On a rainy Sunday morning, his match against Pablo Carreno Busta, under the roof in Arthur Ashe Stadium, was the only game in town. Shapovalov made a splash this summer with his upset wins in an oversized white baseball cap, but today the cap was navy blue (italicized links refer to photographs). His game remains the same: aggressive groundstrokes, including a one-handed backhand, pretty big serving (but with some yips on the toss, which he caught fairly often), and an affinity for the net, albeit one that was not always rewarded. Carreno Busta is in the classic Spanish mode: he’ll stay out there all day and keep getting the ball back, in the expectation that eventually you’ll miss or give him an opening. Thus, he ventured to net 15 times on the match, and Shapovalov came in 44 times. Their success rates were 73% and 61%, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShapovalov drew first blood, breaking for 4-2, and he served for the first set at 5-3, but then his serve deserted him and Carreno Busta broke at 15. When the Spaniard served at 5-6, Shapovalov earned two set points at 15-40 and another after deuce, but Carreno Busta hung on to force a tiebreak, which he dominated, 7-2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis became the pattern of the match, albeit with Carreno Busta taking the lead in the second set and Shapovalov in the third – but it all came down to the tiebreaks. In the end, Carreno Busta prevailed in all three of them, easily, resulting in a score of 7-6(2) 7-6(4), 7-6(3). Cumulatively, then, Carreno Busta won the tiebreaks by a tally of 21-9. In the match as a whole, Carreno Busta’s edge in points was only 128-124, which means that Shapovalov had an edge of 115-107, or 51.8%, on the non-tiebreak points. Usually, winning that percentage of the points is a sure path to victory, and maybe one day it will be for the young Canadian. On this day, the veteran was too steady when it mattered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rain having stopped, my next stop was the Grandstand, where I saw the top seeds in the men’s doubles, Henri Kontinen and John Peers, grab the final three games in a 7-6(3) 6-4 win over the Russians Mikhail Elgin and Daniil (The Coin Tosser) Medvedev. Whenever I’ve seen Kontinen and Peers, the Finn has always seemed like a much better player than the Aussie. Maybe Kontinen sees something subtle about Peers’s game that I’m missing; maybe he’s a loyal guy; or maybe he figures it doesn’t pay to tamper with success – regardless of the tendency of doubles specialists to change partners faster than a National Enquirer\\xad-friendly movie star.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next match on the Grandstand was the highlight of my day, as I got to see the little grinder Diego Schwartzman take on the Frenchman Lucas Pouille. Pouille is listed at 6’1”, but he seemed like a giant next to Schwartzman, generously listed at 5’7” but looking like he still shops in the boys’ department. Schwartzman has the ability to drive opponents crazy, most notably last year, in the final of the one ATP event he has won, when he sent Grigor Dimitrov into a racquet-smashing frenzy. His success at this US Open has prompted learned analysis of the importance of height in tennis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPouille, who eliminated Rafael Nadal at last year’s US Open, took an early lead, breaking Schwartzman in the fourth game after the Argentine had taken a 40-15 lead. The Argentine broke back in the next game. The point of the match came in the eleventh game, when Schwartzman poked a lob volley over Pouille’s head, and Pouille then pulled off a tweener lob for a winner. Schwartzman won the ensuing tiebreak 7-3, closing it out with an inside-out forehand that clipped the tape but still went for a winner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPouille led for most of the second set, breaking Schwartzman twice, but the persistent Argentine secured a second break of his own to level the set at 4-4. With Pouille serving at 5-6 30-40, Schwartzman delivered the goods and a decisive third break with a forehand passing shot, and thus a sudden two-set lead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith the sun a factor early in the third set, Schwartzman turned his baseball cap forward for a period, using the bill to shield his eyes. Pouille came back, dominating the set with two breaks of serve. At 5-2, the trainer worked on Schwartzman’s legs, and the Argentine barely ran in the eighth and final game of the set before receiving more treatment, standing during the break between the third and fourth sets. It seemed questionable whether Schwartzman had anything left to give.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly in the fourth set, Pouille broke Schwartzman at love for a 2-1 lead. But Schwartzman broke back – also at love – for 2-2; gifted with a double fault on break point, he broke again for 4-2. Pouille’s last stand came in the seventh game, when Schwartzman saved three break points, closing it out with an 86 mph second-serve ace up the T. Schwartzman sealed the win, 7-6(3) 7-5 2-6 6-2, with another break of serve, again at love. The match concluded on a review of a double-fault call. Pouille’s challenge was overruled, the US Open had an unlikely quarterfinalist, and I had a picture of a US Open scene: a couple who brought their baby (one of many) to the tournament, near a guy dressed in ’70s garb who was toting a wood racquet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThough Schwartzman is hardly an imposing figure, he somehow managed to serve 9 aces in the match, compared to 15 for Pouille. He won 64% of his first-serve points, not to the standard of the Frenchman’s 69%, but shone on second serve, with an edge of 53% to 41%. The match provided a change from groundstroke grinding, as the players showed creativity in combining drop shots and lobs, as well as frequent forays to the net – 34 for Schwartzman and 28 for Pouille. After the match, Schwartzman said he had worried about his leg in the fourth set, but perhaps Pouille did, too – a theory confirmed by the loser. As the fourth set went on, Pouille appeared to manifest a belief that Schwartzman was fine, as the Frenchman stopped playing drop shots to test his opponent’s mobility. Pouille’s lament was: “It’s not easy to play against someone you’re not sure what’s going on with. I’m hesitating between just putting the ball in the court or being aggressive, and at the end I lose my timing, I get tight and I can’t stay in the match at all. He seemed to get better and better, but I lost my mind on my own and it’s a pity.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery year, I try to see some doubles and some juniors at the Open. I saw plenty of doubles last week, and I filled my junior quota by journeying to Court 13, where the sixth seed in the boys’ singles, the lefthander Yshai Oliel, faced an American wild card, Ryan Goetz, who sports a one-handed backhand. It seems that the USTA is cutting costs: at the junior matches, there are no linesmen on the baselines, with the job of calling those lines falling to the umpire. There is also a 25-second clock intended to keep play moving, but at least in this match it was not enforced.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI arrived early in the first set, after the players had exchanged breaks of serve. From there, the players held serve until the tenth game. Goetz was up 40-30 on his serve, but Oliel won a long rally for deuce. Goetz bravely served and volleyed, but he left Oliel’s return go, only to see it land in the court. At set point, Goetz netted a forehand, and Oliel was up 6-4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStarting the second set, Oliel scrambled out of a 0-40 jam, broke for 2-0, and held for 3-0, a run of five straight games. Goetz pulled off a three-game string of his own, with a hold, a break, and a hold. Again, it was the tenth game that decided matters: serving at 4-5, Goetz fell behind 15-40 and put a forehand into the net on match point. While Oliel had won the contest, 6-4 6-4, he hardly dominated his lower-ranked opponent, and I have to wonder whether he’s got the goods to make a splash on the tour. This being the US Open, however, there is always something new to see: on this occasion, a dog wearing Burberry paid a visit to the court. I can only guess that the fashionable pup was some kind of service animal, a status that can be gamed by a cagey owner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI then repaired to the temporary Armstrong, where Kevin Anderson had won the first two sets against the 35-year-old Italian “foot soldier of tennis” and major-league grunter Paolo Lorenzi, but the Italian had taken the third and was up a break in the fourth. The stadium is not the most comfortable place to watch a match, but fortunately the USTA allowed everyone into the premium seats, so I was able to get closer to the action and have the benefit of a seatback.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe can forgive Lorenzi his grunting, because a man of his age and stature should not have to retrieve the rockets coming off the racquet of a 6’8” behemoth. But, as any good foot soldier might say, this is the business we’ve chosen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShortly after my arrival, Anderson broke back to level the fourth set. Serving at 3-4, Lorenzi fell behind 0-40, but reeled off five consecutive points to stay alive, including one where he had to run down a lob and eventually won the point on an inside-out backhand. The next time Lorenzi served, he fell behind by 0-40 again, and this time there were no answers: a missed backhand on triple match point gave the contest to the South African, 6-4 6-3 6-7(4) 6-4, who improved his career record against Lorenzi to 4-0.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI stayed for the night session, or at least its outset. With the roof open on Ashe on a moonlit night, the third seed, Garbine Muguruza, was taking on Petra Kvitova. Each has won two major titles; the Czech is coming back from a stabbing sustained in a horrific home invasion, but didn’t show any obvious ill effects. Coming into the match, Muguruza had won the first meeting between the pair and Kvitova the next two.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKvitova was the aggressor throughout the match: she was responsible for ending 66 points (with a winner/error ratio of 24/42), as compared to only 32 for Muguruza (7/25). Muguruza broke first for a 3-1 lead, but Kvitova saved three break points in the sixth game to stay in the set and then broke back in the seventh. Muguruza saved a break point at 4-4 but was broken at 5-5. At 6-5, however, Kvitova could not serve out the set, broken at 15. Kvitova fell behind in the tiebreak, losing the first point on her serve, but ran away with it from there, 7-3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMuguruza broke serve to open the second set but Kvitova returned the favor twice. She reached a match point when Muguruza served at 2-5, but misfired, and then it was her task to try to serve out the match. The final game was arduous, as Kvitova had to save three break points, but she was up to the task and closed out the win, 7-6(3) 6-3. With a margin of 81-67 in points won, Kvitova had earned her victory. She had had problems on second serve, winning only 38% of those 37 points, but bagged 78% of her 45 first-serve points and 48% of Muguruza’s service points.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was one more match in the night session, between Sam Querrey and Mischa Zverev, but I was worn out and opted for the subway home. This was either the right call, because the match was no contest, with Zverev netting only five games, or the wrong one, because Querrey reportedly played excellent tennis and, in any event, wrapped up the proceedings in 76 minutes, but my US Open, and thus my summer, were already over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['Two Surprises\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 1, 2014\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy wife and I had tickets for the night session on Labor Day. Neither of the two surprises mentioned in the title took place on the court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst, a word of amplification: I have been informed that the outfits I had seen at the Milos Raonic-Peter Gojowczyk match in the second round were lederhosen. I feel like I should have known that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe gates open for the night session at 6:00 p.m., which gives patrons a chance to see some day session matches, if they can squeeze in. We got off the subway and were approaching the grounds at about 5:30 when we heard our names being called. Going in the opposite direction, toward the subway, were my uncle and three cousins, bedraggled after spending the heart of the day session in the heat and humidity of a real summer day. With thousands of people moving in each direction on the boardwalk linking the subway and the National Tennis Center, the chances of their noticing us – especially as we hadn’t planned to meet – must have been slim. The second surprise came in the second night match, about which more later.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe were standing on the security line waiting for the gates to open when a few drops of rain fell at about 5:55. The tournament officials thereupon had mercy and opened the gates; fortunately, the rain blew over. We tried to get into Armstrong to watch Stan Wawrinka play Tommy Robredo, but there was a line that looked like it was good for at least an hour’s wait. Stephanie Myles, referring to the US Open’s “line problem,” reports on a similar difficulty earlier on Labor Day, as Novak Djokovic played on Armstrong. Rather than risk a long and ultimately fruitless spell on line, we repaired to the Grandstand, where we got excellent seats behind the court for a third-round mixed doubles match between the third seeds, Cara Black and Leander Paes, each the owner of over fifty doubles titles, and last year’s finalists, Abigail Spears and Santiago Gonzalez. The latter, at 31, was the youngest player on court, with Paes being the eldest, a distinguished 41. Earlier in the day, Black, playing with Sania Mirza, had won her third-round match in women’s doubles, while Paes, playing with Radek Stepanek, had lost his third-round match in men’s doubles. As though hoping to make life difficult for spectators, or perhaps to give Paes time to recover from his earlier match, the organizers delayed the mixed doubles match to 6:45, which meant that it actually started just after 7:00.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the majors have not adopted the abbreviated form of doubles – no-ad scoring and a match tiebreak in lieu of the third set – in men’s and women’s doubles, the US Open has done so for the mixed. I have a feeling this was a factor in the configurations in this match, as both men played the deuce court. Typically in mixed doubles, the man would play the ad court.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpears had an interesting look, wearing a visor and glasses whose stems fit over the visor, as well as exotic physio tape that looked like tattoos and covered her calves. My wife and the female half of the other couple that joined us concurred that Paes’s combination of shorts and shirt was not quite up to fashion par.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe teams exchanged breaks early in the first set, with Spears (who consistently served over 100 mph) victimized first and Black (whose serve is generally in the eighties, but whose legendary volleying skills are encapsulated in this video) immediately after. Suddenly, Paes was broken at 15 in the tenth game, and the first set thus went to the unseeded team.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGonzalez double-faulted on break point to open the second set. Black and Paes saved two break points in the second game and three in the fourth (recall that, in no-ad scoring, 0-40 constitutes four break points), and they served out the set, 6-4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlack and Paes jumped to a 3-0 lead in the match tiebreak, but this represented an advantage of only one mini-break. With Black serving at 4-2, Gonzalez hit a winning service return down the line, and a challenge revealed that he had hit the line. While Black and Paes returned to a mini-break lead at 5-4, they suddenly fell behind with Black serving at 7-6. On Black’s first service point, Spears returned her second serve for a winner. On Black’s second service point, at 7-7, Gonzalez’s return skipped off the tape for a lucky winner and an 8-7 lead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe match was thus on Gonzalez’s racquet. He put away an overhead to get to 9-7 and two match points. Paes hit a winner to grab back the mini-break and get the opportunity to serve at 8-9. In the exchange that ensued, Gonzalez grabbed a forehand volley opportunity to hit a winner up the middle, and with it to capture the match.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy contingent could see from the Grandstand that there were now at least some seats available in Armstrong, so we hustled over to see Wawrinka versus Robredo. We arrived as Wawrinka was preparing to serve for the match at 5-2 in the fourth set, after he had forged ahead by winning the third set in a 9-7 tiebreak. We saw very little of this match, as Wawrinka made no mistake, closing out the match easily and evidently feeling pretty loose, as he served-and-volleyed a couple of times.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat just about exhausted the available day session matches; there was still a mixed doubles match on Court 5, but the players had reached the match tiebreak, and there was no way we could get over there in time. Thus, we resigned ourselves to Arthur Ashe Stadium. It helped that our tickets were the best of a bad lot. That is, everything above the two tiers of luxury boxes is deficient, but we were in the loge, in the very first row above the luxury boxes. Since the two matches of which we saw fragments were available to the whole world on television, there’s not much to report.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first match we caught was Victoria Azarenka against Aleksandra Krunic. The former, having won the Australian Open in 2012 and 2013 and been a finalist to Serena Williams both years in the US Open, is obviously better than her current ranking of number 17, but injuries have hurt her ranking. Krunic, born in Moscow and playing for Serbia, had played only one Grand Slam singles event before this year’s US Open, losing in the first round at Flushing Meadow last year. Ranked number 145 at age 21, she came out of nowhere – and the qualifying – to defeat two seeds, Madison Keys (number 27) and Petra Kvitova (number 3), on her way to the fourth round and a date with Azarenka.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKrunic had kept her mojo going, winning the first set from Azarenka, 6-4. When we arrived in Ashe, Azarenka was serving to square the match at 5-4 in the second set. On her second set point, she did so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAzarenka, whose grunts are as loud in person as on television, immediately broke to start the third set, and I thought it would be one-way traffic from there, but it was not. In the fourth game, Krunic, who swung freely, broke back. Azarenka got the decisive break in the seventh game, with the help of a lucky shot that dribbled over the net cord at 30-30, followed by the de rigueur and necessarily insincere apology. Krunic was not done, getting to 15-40 in the eighth game and 0-30 in the tenth, but Azarenka pulled through. On match point, Krunic’s service return was called out, and a review on her challenge showed that she had missed by millimeters. There are a lot of talented players out there, so it’s always hard to say who will step up in the ranks, but Krunic looks like at least a Top Fifty talent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe final night match featured Milos Raonic and Kei Nishikori, with the winner slated to take on Wawrinka in the quarterfinals. In honor of the after-dark setting, Raonic had traded in his traditional white compression sleeve for a black number with a yellow pattern. Raonic came out firing on his serve, and the match looked like a heavyweight beating up on a welterweight. He quickly went up a break, and was on the verge of a 5-1 lead when Nishikori fell behind 0-40 in the sixth game. But Nishikori reeled off five straight points to hold serve, and then broke the big man’s serve in the seventh game, recovering from a 40-0 deficit. After Nishikori held for 4-4, Raonic turned the set around, winning eight straight points to take opening frame, 6-4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this point, it was around 11:00 p.m., and my wife and I, in deference to our civilian responsibilities, headed home. It was only the next morning when we learned that this match had gone five sets, tied a US Open record by ending at 2:26 a.m., and resulted in an upset win for Nishikori.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI had promised two surprises in this dispatch. The second came during a changeover in the first set of the Raonic-Nishikori match. On Ashe, the video board features shots of random fans and celebrities. When Jay Pharoah was shown on the board, you didn’t have to be a lip-reader to make out his “WTF” – and he was not referring to the ATP World Tour Finals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['New Armstrong\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 28, 2018\\n\\n\\n\\nOn my first visit to the 2018 US Open, New York’s summer blast furnace was in peak operation. I took refuge in air-conditioned lounges for about 90 minutes in the afternoon, drank lemonade and water throughout the day, and still dropped about three pounds (or 1.4 kilos for our European readers). To state the obvious, the players had it worse, leading the tournament organizers to implement a discretionary Extreme Heat Policy.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, there was no way I’d be getting up close and personal with the foot soldiers of tennis on the outer courts – at least not while the sun was beating down. Nor was I prepared for the rigors of Arthur Ashe Stadium; let’s say it again: great man, terrible stadium. The shady solution that offered a modicum of proximity to the action was the new Louis Armstrong Stadium, which I recommend highly. Though seats in the lower bowl are reserved (as is the case with the new Grandstand), there are enough decent seats above that to make the visit worthwhile. Moreover, a significantly higher percentage of the general admission seats are in the shade, and the terracotta louvers on the north and south sides of the building allow for something of a breeze. Because the louvers were placed at the ends of the court rather than on the sides, there are fewer good seats behind the court than one might like. (Italicized links, except for one connected to a newspaper story, refer to photographs.) My hunch is that it would have been too difficult architecturally to place the louvers on the sides of the court.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the thank-goodness-for-small-favors department, this year the so-called mobile tickets that have largely replaced paper (and completely replaced PDF) may be stored in an Android wallet. Last year, that privilege was limited to iPhone users. What of people who don’t have smartphones? Well, maybe the US Open doesn’t want their business that badly.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy main refuge from the heat was the Chase lounge. I had hoped to use the new American Express Centurion Lounge in Armstrong, which is limited to holders of platinum and centurion cards. I learned that platinum cards from Amex partnerships – in this case, with Delta Airlines – did not fit the bill. Even for those who had the proper cards, there was a wait to get into the lounge, which in any event did not open until noon. Another Amex lounge, adjoining the Chase lounge, is open to the general public. It doesn’t offer much except air conditioning, which was certainly not to be sneered at. It also offered external batteries for cell phones that, at least in my case, worked better than the Chase offering. Oh, and for those who wanted to get their hair blown out, a Drybar salon.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving scouted out a seat behind the Armstrong court well before the 11:00 a.m. start of play, I saw Angelique Kerber and Margarita Gasparyan practicing as a prelude to their playing the second match on the court, and then a riot of little kids, mostly from Connecticut, playing mini-tennis and trying to avoid bopping each other in the head.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first match featured the 2017 Roland Garros champion and tenth seed, Jelena Ostapenko, against the former top-tenner Andrea Petkovic, who will turn 31 on the final day of the tournament. Ostapenko came out of the gate slowly, losing the first six points she served. The first six games featured four breaks of serve. With Petkovic serving at 4-5 0-30, Ostapenko teed off on a second serve return, pulling a backhand down the line from the deuce court for a winner. A double fault, one of eight on the day for Petkovic (Ostapenko was to offer up 11 of her own, as well as countless tosses that she caught), sealed the set.\\n\\n\\n\\nOstapenko scampered to a 3-1 lead in the second set before Petkovic grabbed five of six games to steal the frame. Neither player was wont to run around her backhand, as seems de rigueur these days (at least on the men’s tour), and Petkovic’s toss varied from a little bit to the right of her serving arm to way right. In the latter instances, Ostapenko did not seem to do a very good job of anticipating the inevitable slice serve.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the second set, the players got a ten-minute break, which did more good for Ostapenko than Petkovic, as reported in the New York Times:\\n\\n\\n\\nShe drank some cold water and draped herself in ice towels, changed her drenched socks and wet shoes. She was not permitted to talk to a coach, and didn’t have time to open a David Foster Wallace novel that was packed in her bag.\\n\\n\\n\\n“When I came back out, it felt like five billion degrees,” Petkovic said. “Next time, I would stay out there, chill on the bench.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOstapenko was the far more aggressive player. The official statistics showed her with 38 winners and 60 unforced errors, compared to Petkovic’s 17 and 32. The question at any moment was whether Good Ostapenko or Bad Ostapenko would show up. In the third set, Good Ostapenko got to 5-3 40-15, but Bad Ostapenko lost the two match points and two more to boot, putting Petkovic back on serve. At 5-5, Ostapenko saved two breaks points; at 5-6, Petkovic was able to save a third match point but not a fourth, and the match went to the tenth seed, 6-4 4-6 7-5. Thus, we did not get to see the Petko dance, but I took the first of my air-conditioning breaks.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I returned to Armstrong, Kerber, the winner of three major titles, including this year’s Wimbledon, was up a break on Gasparyan, 3-2, a six-footer with a prodigious one-handed backhand who came into the event ranked number 370, admitted to the draw with a protected ranking. Kerber took care of business all the way to 5-4 40-15, whence Gasparyan saved three set points and broke serve with a backhand winner off a Kerber drop shot. In the tiebreak that eventually ensued, Gasparyan earned the first mini-break with a wonderful combination of a drop shot and stab backhand volley. A down-the-line forehand winner gave her a second mini-break and a 3-0 lead, and the players later changed ends with the underdog ahead by 4-2. But Kerber – less spectacular, but much steadier – righted the ship, taking five of the following six points and, with them, the set.\\n\\n\\n\\nGasparyan broke serve to start the second set, but Kerber broke right back and then held for a 2-1 lead. I was really feeling the heat and humidity, so I took a second air-conditioning break. Kerber would eventually prevail, 7-6(5) 6-3, the most significant difference perhaps being second-serve points, of which she won 53%, while Gasparyan could muster only 39%.\\n\\n\\n\\nI braved the sun on Court 14 for a few minutes of what would ultimately be a five-set win for Jaume Munar (seen here) over Ruben Bemelmans (putting away a sitter here) (5-7 6-3 7-6(3) 2-6 6-1 in 3 hours and 58 minutes), but prudence sent me scurrying back for more air conditioning.\\n\\n\\n\\nEventually, I returned to Armstrong when the temperature was merely hot, rather than scorching, arriving as Sascha Zverev was up 6-2 3-0 over the ultimate lucky loser, Peter Polansky. The rest was a light workout for the fourth seed, who eased to a 6-2 6-1 6-2 victory over Polansky without facing a break point. Zverev’s new coach, Ivan Lendl, watched the proceedings impassively, barely glancing at the video monitor when it showed some highlights of his US Open play. Zverev is an impressive horse for Lendl to ride, but he’s yet to prove his mettle in a major. I imagine he will someday, but I’m less certain of it than I was a year ago.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was now ready for the outside courts and some foot soldiers, as Philipp Kohlschreiber took on his fellow German Yannick Hanfmann on Court 11. Well, let’s not make light of Kohlschreiber: he and his one-handed backhand have been in the top hundred for fourteen years. As I arrived, Hanfmann was offering up his big serve at 4-5 in the third set, the first two sets having been split. Kohlschreiber, who varied his return position from far behind the baseline to nearly bumping into the line judges, retreated all the way back on Hanfmann’s second serve at 30-40 – and drew a double fault that gave him the set. The players got a ten-minute break under the heat policy, followed by a fourth set in which Hanfmann was continually in trouble in his service games. In that set, Kohlschreiber won 41% of his return points, as compared to 13% (3 of 23) for his opponent. Hanfmann saved four break points during the course of the set, but not the fifth, which came at 4-5 15-40, giving Kohlschreiber the win, 7-6(3) 5-7 6-4 6-4. (Meanwhile, in the distance, Robin Haase was over on Court 12, pulling off a win from a two-set deficit to Mackie McDonald, a result saluted with a display of the Dutch flag.)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe heat persisting into the night, the path of least resistance appealed to me, and I stayed on Court 11 for the match between Sorana Cirstea and Alison Riske. A substantial Romanian contingent cheered on Cirstea, looking for something to celebrate after their nation’s two seeded women, Simona Halep (No. 1) and Mihaela Buzarnescu (No. 21), had crashed out. Both players pounded their groundstrokes, Cirstea perhaps somewhat harder, with a more natural whipping motion on her forehand, as opposed to Riske’s stiff-armed slingshot approach. Riske gets her tall frame low for groundstrokes, and follows almost every shot with a grunted “Oy!” (Riske is either engaged or married to Stephen Amritraj, son of Anand, the back of whose head I believe appears in this photo. Readers of these dispatches will recall my being interviewed by Stephen’s cousin Prakash, son of Vijay, at Wimbledon in 2016.)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chair umpire pronounced the American’s name “Risky,” though I believe the correct pronunciation is “Risk.” As the match progressed, the umpire faced a rather more controversial issue, as you’ll see shortly. The Court 12 diversion during this match was Genie Bouchard, who scored an easy win over the French wild card Harmony Tan.\\n\\n\\n\\nCirstea, who has been ranked as high as number 21 and reached the Roland Garros quarterfinals in 2009, broke serve in the eighth game and served out the first set at 30. In the second set, Riske saved a break point at 3-3 and then broke for 5-3 before serving out the set.\\n\\n\\n\\nRiske jumped out ahead in the third set with the help of a lucky net cord winner that set up break point. Serving at 2-1, she climbed out of a 0-40 hole to hold serve. On the first point of the ninth game, with Cirstea serving at 3-5, Riske’s shot was called long. Riske challenged the call successfully, and the umpire called the score “0-15.” Cirstea went medieval on the umpire, yelling “No, no, no!” and explaining – with a reasoned basis, so far as I can recall where she had been relative to the ball when it was called out – that she did not play the shot in deference to the erroneous call. The crowd, or at least the Romanians, shouted: “Replay the point! Replay the point!” The umpire could not back down at that point, and she rejected Cirstea’s pleas.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo what happened after this hubbub? Cirstea reeled off nine consecutive points – so much for Riske serving for the match at 5-4 – and eventually took a 6-5 lead. Serving at 5-6, Riske fell behind 0-30 and saved match points at 30-40 and ad-out with two crosscourt forehand winners. On the third match point, Riske sprayed a forehand long, and Cirstea had a comeback victory, 6-3 3-6 7-5. If it’s any consolation to Riske, an observer noted that both players in this match had been better than either player in the Ostapenko-Petkovic match. It was 9:18 p.m., and I hauled my limp body to the subway. The good news: when I return on August 30, the temperature is supposed to top out at only 90°F or – for our European readership – a mere 32.2°C.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['The Heat Is (Still) On\\n\\n\\n\\nSeptember 3, 2018\\n\\n\\n\\nMy final US Open visit for 2018 came on another hot and humid day. Every year, I try to make some time for doubles and juniors. This year, I didn’t do so well on that resolution. Each of my three days at the Open was so uncomfortably warm that the main consideration – perhaps the only consideration – was staying in the shade. That militated in favor of the new Louis Armstrong Stadium, especially on September 3, when my wife and I were fortunate enough to have reserved seats in the lower bowl. Uncharacteristically, I watched matches in only one venue, as Armstrong served its purpose. Indeed, as the New York Times has reported, Armstrong is the place to be.\\n\\n\\n\\nI began on the 7 train, where a couple from Dublin were making an impromptu trip to the Open – that is, they were arriving without tickets, a brave (or naïve) move to pull on Labor Day. I advised them to get grounds passes if they could (as rain was not going to be an issue, so they didn’t need Ashe or Armstrong tickets) and, in any event, to return on Tuesday, when it would be much easier and cheaper to buy tickets. I hope they made it into the tournament on Monday, but I’ll never know.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my first match of the day, Kei Nishikori faced the newlywed Philipp Kohlschreiber, both of whom I’d seen earlier in the event. Both have the idiosyncrasy of taking only one ball before first serve, thus needing to pause for assistance from a ball boy (or girl) if they serve a fault. This is striking for Kohlschreiber, who hits a throwback one-handed backhand (italicized hyperlinks refer to photographs) – but no one these days is quite so throwback as to hold two balls on the toss for first serve. (In photos from the old days, one can see a spare ball being held by Pancho Gonzales, Lew Hoad, Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Fred Stolle, Margaret Court, Evonne Goolagong, and Katharine Hepburn.)\\n\\n\\n\\nAs when he had faced Yannick Hanfmann, Kohlschreiber returned serve from very deep in the court. He started out fairly successfully, reaching break point in the first game of the match, but Nishikori held on and then broke for a 2-0 lead. Neither player was dominating on serve: Kohlschreiber broke back to get to 1-2, but Nishikori broke again for a 3-1 lead. From there, Nishikori stayed the course, holding serve for the remainder of the set until he closed it out, 6-3.\\n\\n\\n\\nNishikori cruised through the second set, 6-2, breaking serve in the first and fifth games. Kohlschreiber began to wear a baseball cap for protection against the sun, but only when receiving serve.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the third set, Nishikori, who was probably feeling pretty grateful to Kohlschreiber for knocking Sascha Zverev out of the tournament, took the lead by breaking serve in the seventh game. He served for the match at 5-4 and got to 30-0 before some big hitting by Kohlschreiber got him back into the game. On a third break point, Nishikori dropped a forehand half-volley into the net, and the score was 5-5.\\n\\n\\n\\nNishikori struck back in the next game, hitting two backhand service returns down the line for winners and eventually breaking serve with a crosscourt forehand. On his second try to serve out the match, Nishikori got to 40-15 and closed out the contest two points later, falling to the court in relief at his 6-3 6-2 7-5 victory.\\n\\n\\n\\nNext up were two twenty-year-olds, Naomi Osaka and Aryna Sabalenka. Osaka had certainly been on a roll: in the second round, from 2-2 in the first set, she reeled off ten straight games against Julia Glushko, and then threw a double-bagel at Aliaksandra Sasnovich, who had just missed being seeded. Going into the match, however, Jeff Sackmann’s rating system had Sabalenka as the most likely player to win the women’s singles. Sabalenka bolstered her case by holding serve in the first game, snapping Osaka’s string of 22 straight games. In the fifth game, Sabalenka climbed out of 0-40 with two big serves but then double faulted on the third break point to fall behind. When Sabalenka fell behind by 0-40 once more at 3-5, she did no climbing, and Osaka clinched the set, 6-3.\\n\\n\\n\\nSabalenka is physically imposing, down to her unfortunate tattoo, while Osaka seems frail – until you see her hit the ball. Sabalenka is a loud grunter, Osaka a quiet assassin. Sabalenka struck first in the second set, breaking for 2-1 and again for 4-1. By the end of the set, Osaka’s first service speed had dipped into the low nineties – from 110 mph and up – and her movement was labored. She saved two set points at 1-5 but Sabalenka closed out the set in the next game, punctuating the effort with an ace.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs reported by Christopher Clarey in the New York Times, the ten-minute heat break before the third set allowed Osaka to regroup, even though Sabalenka notched the first break of serve. Osaka promptly broke back and had opportunities to break again in the sixth game (0-40) and in the eighth (0-30). Though Sabalenka denied those opportunities, in the tenth game, her double fault gave Osaka three match points. Again, Sabalenka got out of trouble, but not all the way. A fourth match point ensued, and Sabalenka could stem the tide no more, double faulting and throwing her racquet in disgust. In the end, Osaka was a little bit better: making 66% of first serves, compared to Sabalenka’s 59%; winning 68% of first-serve points, compared to 67%; and succeeding on 53% of second-serve points, compared to 52%. I’ll be surprised if neither of these players eventually wins a major.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe third match of the day featured two top-tenners in the 2014 champion, Marin Cilic, and David Goffin. In the opening game, Cilic squandered a 30-0 lead and lost serve on a double fault. The players held serve from there until Goffin served for the set at 5-4, when Cilic grabbed a break point with a forehand volley deftly placed behind Goffin and cashed it in when Goffin missed a backhand. The players found their way to a tiebreak in which nine points went against the server and only five with him. Cilic never trailed, though he could not have enjoyed going from serving at 5-2 to 5-5. Eventually, he strung two points together to win the tiebreak, 8-6, when Goffin, serving to save a second set point, hit a backhand wide.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the set, the scoreboard and public address system called for a memorial tribute to Sen. John McCain. I took a moment of silence as a better tribute than applause for the recently departed, but it’s hard to know which response was more appropriate. Others disagreed with me and applauded.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter escaping with the first set, Cilic broke serve in the third game of the second, but he never seemed to develop a feeling of comfort and ease: he bounced the ball a great deal before serving, especially on second serve, where the service clock was not a factor. While one thinks of Cilic as a big server – at 6’6”, he would have been a pure serve-and-volleyer in another era – his fastest serve of the match was only 127 mph. For a big man, however, he hits groundstrokes that are both steady and powerful, opening opportunities to win points on short balls or at the net. Even without a huge serve, the importance of the first delivery to Cilic was plain, perhaps because of his great success with sharply angled first serves: his winning percentage dropped off from 83% to 47% when he had to rely on a second serve; for the diminutive Goffin, the delta was a mere five percentage points: 60% versus 55%.\\n\\n\\n\\nRegardless of his state of mind, Cilic continued to cruise through the second set, pulling out of 15-40 in the eighth game with two of his twelve aces and closing out the set, 6-2. The lights went on at 6:07, before the third set began. Cilic pulled ahead with a break in the fifth game and held serve steadily to get to 5-4 and 40-30, at which point Goffin mounted a last stand. After saving two match points, Goffin got to break point, but he was unable to return Cilic’s serve when opportunity knocked. On a third match point, Cilic hit a crosscourt forehand winner to seal the victory, 7-6(6) 6-2 6-4. He celebrated by giving towels to fans who’d been cheering him on in the first couple of rows.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, I got to keep my doubles pledge, as the last match on Armstrong was a mixed doubles quarterfinal between Bethanie Mattek-Sands/Jamie Murray and Nadiia Kichenok/Wesley Koolhof. This year, the logo on the net for all matches is Mercedes – no more Chase – but the official still had to replace the net when we switched from singles to doubles.\\n\\n\\n\\nI noticed early on that Murray, who was sporting a nasty bandage on his right knee, started his service motion about six inches behind the baseline and stepped forward, appearing to touch the baseline on occasion. Before the match ended, he would be called for two foot-faults. He also tends to hit his overheads with a stiff-arm motion akin to the “sky hook” that Jimmy Connors used to hit when the ball had got behind him.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Kichenok’s box, there was a blond woman who looked remarkably like her and showed up on the video screen fairly often during the match. The fans behind me were speculating on whether she might be Kichenok’s twin sister, and now the answer can be told: she is. Her name is Lyudmyla, and the sisters have been doubles partners.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the risk of spoiling the suspense, it’s worth noting that the better-known team of Mattek-Sands and Murray won 94 of 176 points in the match, or 53%, which is almost always enough to seal the win. For much of the match, too, it seemed they were in control – but the match was not in the bag, and threatened to enter Simpson’s Paradox country.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the opening set, Kichenok was broken in the third game, and Murray served for the frame at 5-4 – but he was broken at love. Mixed doubles at the US Open is played with no-ad scoring and a match tiebreak in lieu of a third set, so when Kichenok served at 5-5 deuce, she was facing a break point. On deciding points, the player of the same gender as the server is to receive. (In men’s and women’s doubles, which are played with no-ad scoring on the regular tour but not during the majors, the receiving team can choose who will return serve on deciding points. In this match, both men received in the deuce court while the women played the ad court.) On this occasion, Murray – whose movement at the net created problems for the opposition – left home early enough for Kichenok to hit a backhand pass into the space he had vacated, and she held serve.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter Mattek-Sands (who, of course, has a notable tattoo of her own) held at love, Kichenok and Koolhof took a 4-2 lead in the ensuing tiebreak. Mattek-Sands and Murray swept through five of the next six points, however, to steal the set. On set point, Kichenov, the server, lobbed over Mattek-Sands, and the ball was called good on the sideline. Mattek-Sands challenged, and the ball was wide, deciding the set.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the best features of mixed doubles is that it lends itself to having all four players at the net, and this happened several times in the match.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the second set, Murray, who had started the match without a cap, changed his shirt – and his cap to match – making the move from black to white. Three times in the set, games went to deuce; all three (twice with Kichenok serving, once with Mattek-Sands), the serving team survived the break point. In the tiebreak, the underdogs took a 5-2 lead and reached double set point at 6-4, with Koolhof serving. He put a crosscourt forehand passing shot wide, and then, with Mattek-Sands serving, Kishenok’s return hit her partner in the back, so it was 6-6. On Mattek-Sands’s next service point, Koolhof hit a backhand return for a winner. Kishenok served at 7-6, and Koolhof poached to put away a volley and take the set.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis brought the contest to a match tiebreak. Kichenok and Koolhof took a 5-3 lead, but Koolhof missed a half-volley to give back a mini-break, and Kichenok double-faulted at 5-6 to return another. Mattek-Sands served at 7-6 and won two points with strong volleys: maintaining a firm wrist to hit a low ball behind the crossing Koolhof for 8-6 and then a reflex volley winner for 9-6 and match point. On his serve, Koolhof saved one match point but dropped the second with a backhand pass that went long.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus, Mattek-Sands and Murray won seven of the final nine points to prevail by 7-6(5) 6-7(6) [10-7], ending my US Open day at 9:29 p.m. As I left the grounds for the last time this year, I reflected on some of the good things about the tournament, much as I complain about the crowding, the heat, and the security (though the latter worked rapidly this year). The new Armstrong is a significant upgrade. Fans can bring food and cameras onto the grounds, in contrast with the New York Open, which lost my patronage with its restrictive policies. And, if the heat keeps up, you can lose weight without exercising. Next year…some juniors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['Not a Word About the Future Roof on Ashe\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 31, 2015\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the second consecutive year, I attended the first session of the US Open, with this year’s program somewhat more appealing than last year’s, as the first round has been compressed from an unnecessarily long three days to two. My first match of the day was on Court 13, where I saw Jelena Jankovic practicing (she was to lose later in the day; hyperlinks in red refer to photographs) before the opener between David Goffin of Belgium, the fourteenth seed, and the Italian veteran Simone Bolelli, the reigning (with Fabio Fognini) Australian Open men’s doubles champion. Goffin wore classic Lacoste, while Bolelli, who sported a wedding band, wore clothing from Hydrogen, with a truly ugly death’s-head logo. Bolelli, who turns 30 in October, is one of the dwindling band of players who hits his backhand with one hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMusic was blaring from outside the court for most of the match. Is such a thing imaginable at Wimbledon? I should think not.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first set was close, but Goffin, who had chosen to receive, took the lead in the seventh game when Bolelli double faulted on break point. After that, it was clear sailing for the Belgian, 6-4 6-1 6-2. Bolelli went 0-for-3 on break points while Goffin cashed in a robust 6 of 9 times. Goffin, who averaged only 113 mph on his first serve and 88 on his second, somehow served 13 aces – the lesson, as always, being that placement counts for something. Not a big man, Goffin has broken into the top twenty with speed and defense. It’s hard to imagine him winning a major, but easy to picture him remaining seeded at the majors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile this was going on, I saw dribs and drabs of the match on Court 14 (one of the second-tier courts, with no speed gun and no singles net) between Marsel Ilhan and Radek Stepanek – or, as I like to think of him, dirty old man Radek Stepanek (he turns 37 in November and his personal life is a matter of public record). Stepanek, one of the few players still around who knows how to find his way to the net before the post-match handshake, ran out of gas, retiring in the fourth set while trailing two sets to one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext, I checked out the current Roland Garros boys’ singles champion, Tommy Paul, in his match against the 25th seed, Andreas Seppi, on Court 6. The venue is part of a complex of three new courts, numbers 4, 5, and 6. Court 5 has all the bells and whistles, including the capacity for review of disputed calls, while the flanking courts are poor relations akin to Court 14. While Seppi and Paul fought it out on Court 6, Court 5 had a big crowd for Fernando Verdasco and Tommy Haas. Of the four combatants, none was in his twenties, and Paul was only one under 30. He got a wild card into qualifying and won his three matches in impressive style.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI arrived with Seppi leading, 6-4 6-0 2-3. Seppi’s game is familiar, while Paul was new to me. He hits his forehand with a ton of topsin, in the Nadal/Sock mode, but with frequent mishits, at least when I was present. Serving at 4-4 30-30, Paul missed two forehands for what looked like a decisive break of serve. In the tenth game, Seppi had two match points on his serve, but he, too, was broken. Alas for Paul, he was broken again in the next game, and Seppi, after double faulting on his third match point, cashed in his fourth for a 6-4 6-0 7-5 win.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI stopped on the way to Court 17, where I was to watch Milos Raonic and Tim Smyczek, to watch the big television screen in the plaza of the tennis center as Benoit Paire finished up his five-set upset of last year’s finalist, Kei Nishikori. When I got onto 17, Raonic had just wrapped up the first set. Raonic, featuring his usual compression sleeve, was wearing a color-coordinated ensemble that put me in mind of a pumpkin with a 147 mph serve.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second set went on serve, which must be to Smyczek’s credit, as he was bringing a knife to a gunfight. When Raonic served, Smyczek stood closer to the back fence than to the baseline, which gave Raonic the ability to play serve-and-volley and to hit effective angles and drop volleys.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt 5-5 in the tiebreak, Raonic served a 140 mph bomb but then netted an overhead, giving Smyczek a chance to serve out the set, but Raonic stole the point with a forehand drop half-volley. Smyczek then double-faulted to give Raonic a set point on his serve, but Smyczek got even at 7-7 with a down-the-line forehand. The decisive mini-break took place at 8-8, when Smyczek sprayed a backhand long. Raonic took care of business on his serve, with Smyczek’s errant forehand sailing into the stands.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun was oppressive on Court 17, so I took a break in the Chase Lounge and forewent the third set. (It’s worth mentioning that this year visitors to the Chase Lounge can register in an odd location: at the Chase Lounge. Last year, we had to trek through the food court, for which there had to be some good explanation, but I can’t imagine what it was.) It was just as well, as Raonic cruised to a 6-4 7-6(8) 6-1 victory. I was told by a cousin who stayed to the end that Raonic closed out the match with a series of serves at 140 mph and up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter some lemonade to avert dehydration, I repaired to Louis Armstrong Stadium, where the defending champion, Marin Cilic (a year ago, who expected that phrase to be accurate?), had a two-set lead over the left-handed qualifier Guido Pella. (Armstrong, not to mention, will not be around forever, as is well-advertised at the Open.) The better players have familiar characteristics, and for Cilic the most notable may be the way his right elbow remains slightly bent as he draws back the racquet in his service motion. Pella briefly opened up some daylight in the third set with a break in the third game, but Cilic drew even when he broke back in the eighth. The tiebreak was something of a rout, as Cilic closed it out, 7-3, when Pella double faulted. A first-round win at Roland Garros in 2013 remains Pella’s only victory in Grand Slam singles play.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sun had become somewhat less powerful by now, and I headed out to Court 15 to watch Pablo Cuevas against Dudi Sela. Nick Bolletieri, who’s looking good for 84, passed through and signed autographs before the match began. This contest was another veteran matchup, as Sela is 30 and soon to be a father of two, while Cuevas turns 30 on New Year’s Day. It was thus fitting that this was a matchup of two one-handed backhands, with both players, especially Cuevas, showing versatility and power without the benefit of a second hand on the racquet. The first set was a runaway, as Cuevas built a 4-0 lead and cruised to a 6-2 win. Sela turned things around in the second set, breaking for a 5-3 lead and serving it out, though not without a hiccup, as he slid from 40-0 to ad out in the decisive game. Perhaps the turning point of the match came in the fifth game of the third set, when Cuevas saved three break points. Sela wavered when he served at 4-5, double faulting to give Cuevas a set point and, after saving that one, missing an inside-out forehand wide and another forehand long. Suspecting that the fight was out of Sela, I moved on at that point, and I was correct, as Cuevas pulled away for a 6-2 3-6 6-4 6-1 win. This marks only the third time in nine tries that Cuevas has made it to the second round at Flushing Meadow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy next stop was Armstrong, which was supposed to host a Maria Sharapova match to end the day session. After Sharapova withdrew from the event, the match between Gael Monfils and Ilya Marchenko was moved to this show court. Monfils’s mannerisms are nothing if not familiar by now: the hunch over as he prepares to receive serve, the feet pressed together in his service motion. The Frenchman was up a break at 3-1 in the first set when I arrived and added another break before closing out the set.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the second set, facing a break point in the fourth game, Monfils slipped and fell. Not only was his serve broken, but he remained on his back for a while. When he got back up, he seemed to move well again, and he even broke back in the ninth game. But Monfils double faulted at 4-5 30-40 to hand the set to Marchenko, tying the contest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the opening game of the third set, Marchenko saved two break points. Suddenly, Monfils was serving change-ups — as I’d seen him do in 2013 against John Isner, albeit apparently for strategic reasons then. Marchenko broke his serve and held for 3-0, and then Monfils took a medical timeout. Later, after Marchenko had opened a 5-0 lead, the trainer came onto the court and worked on Monfils’s back. Two points later, with Monfils trailing 0-30, he walked to the net, tossing his racquet into the stands and retiring. He later explained that he could not move because of a lingering back problem, though another report spoke of an elbow injury caused by the fall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy final stop of the day was Court 17, where I arrived just after the volatile Fabio Fognini, seeded 32nd, had taken a lead of two sets to one over Steve Johnson. As I had discussed three years ago, Johnson will do anything to avoid hitting a backhand, and that remained the case against Fognini. In a way, he’s a poor man’s John Isner, all serve and forehand, except the Johnson serve is not nearly as dangerous. To be fair, Johnson is a lot more mobile than Isner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the fourth set, Johnson held serve with difficulty in the second game and then broke Fognini in the third. In the sixth game, Johnson held on for a 4-2 lead, even after a brouhaha in which Fognini, for once, was blameless. Fognini had challenged an out call and the video board showed the word “OUT” even as the diagram showed the ball touching the line. The umpire gave this one to Fognini, though he upset the Italian in the next game when he awarded the point to Johnson after a call was overruled rather than ordering the point replayed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nServing at 3-5, Fognini saved a set point and put the onus to win the set on Johnson, a burden he did not come close to sustaining. After losing the first point on his serve, Johnson served three consecutive double faults to level the set at 5-5.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJohnson did not fold up after that debacle, getting to 15-40 in Fognini’s next service game before the Italian held serve, leading Johnson to smash his racquet. In the twelfth game, Johnson rediscovered his serve and sent the set to a tiebreak, which proved anticlimactic: Fognini raced to a 5-0 lead and cruised to a 7-2 win to close out the match, 2-6 6-3 6-4 7-6(2). Fognini celebrated by tossing his headband into the crowd and my day of tennis had ended nearly eleven hours after it had begun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
