I’m all for soccer players that goes into tackles hard, and who really play physical. A couple of my favorite players are Gattuso, Roy Keane, Patrick Vieria and Paul Scholes, just because of their commitment on the pitch and that they don’t take any sh’’t.

This player however needs to get banned from soccer all over the world, his name is Luis Moreno. Imagine Hitler mixed with Stalin on crack and you get Luis Moreno.



Compare this guy with Rooney who gets suspended for saying something that every player says 20 times in a game. Imagine FA trying to control this guy. He probably try to kick them as a solution to his problem.

An idiot abroad
