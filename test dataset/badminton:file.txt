| Playing badminton whether for fun as a hobby or on a more competitive |
| level will improve your overall health significantly when done for at |
| least 30 minutes a day. Many national and official health             |
| institutions recommend that you attempt to raise your heart rate for  |
| A MINIMUM OF 30 MINUTES A DAY to keep your metabolism at a healthy    |
| rate as well as to lower your resting heart BPM (beats per minute).   |
| Other than simply being healthy for the benefit of raising your heart |
| rate and all the positive effects of raising your heart rate,         |
| badminton is often a total body work out. When you practice or even   |
| play a full match of badminton (three games) you will have been       |
| moving for at least 30 minutes and you will be using muscles that you |
| are not always aware of. By moving your body quickly around the court |
| and swinging your racket for the shots you are exercising almost      |
| every muscle in your body without even thinking about it.             |
| When you exercise to build muscle and tone your body the main goal is |
| to exercise the muscle to the point of exhaustion. This is done by    |
| repeatedly stretching and working any muscle you want to tone. By     |
| stretching and working the muscle you activate the muscle fibers      |
| which release hormones into your body that help your body to increase |
| the tone and mass of your muscles. Badminton can help you to do this  |
| and that can be part of what is badminton.                            |
| Moving from front to back and side to side of the badminton court     |
| will not only exercise all the muscles in your legs it will help you  |
| to build muscle. The repetition in the actions you are taking as you  |
| play the game tends to work much like the repetitions you will find   |
| in many weight lifting programs, minus the weights.                   |
| Instead of using weights to build the muscle you are repeatedly       |
| carrying the weight of your body and the momentum that adds to that   |
| weight. Often if you were to work out in a fitness gym or club you    |
| would be sitting to lift the weights, in badminton you are not only   |
| activating the fibers in your muscles that help to strengthen them    |
| you are combining that with aerobic activity creating a total work    |
| out for your legs.                                                    |
| When you combine this leg work out with swinging your racket in all   |
| sorts of directions to return all types of badminton shots you are    |
| incorporating all of your upper body muscles into this workout as     |
| well. The swinging of the racket will be close to weight lifting as   |
| well.                                                                 |
| Even though most badminton rackets are light weight and easy to swing |
| you are adding that little bit of weight along with the momentum of   |
| the swing, this activates far more muscle fibers than if you were to  |
| sit and simply do repetitive lifting of a heavier weight. And again   |
| you are combining this type of weight lifting with aerobic all body   |
| activity to produce a raised heart rate and increase your metabolism. |
| As you think about this you may wonder why there are not huge overly  |
| muscular badminton players. This is not because they are not reaping  |
| the full benefit of the badminton work out it is simply because       |
| badminton is going to be a toning sport.                              |
| The activity that is involved will help you to tone your muscles all  |
| while burning excess calories and fat deposits. Beside if you were to |
| create a huge muscular physical state for yourself you would no       |
| longer have the quick agile ability to move around the court as a     |
| successful badminton player needs.                                    |
