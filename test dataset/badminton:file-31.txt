Nutrition and Badminton

Nutrition is an important component of badminton because it is an energy
sapping, fast paced, quick reflexes oriented, fast racket game where the
SPEED OF THE SMASH IS MORE THAN 200MPH when the shuttle leaves the
racket after the smash.

| So a badminton player has to take care of his NUTRITIONAL             |
| REQUIREMENTS on and off his badminton days to maintain a balance. For |
| example, on an off day, you may require 2500 to 3000 calories whereas |
| on competition day, you may require up to 5000 calories. Similarly,   |
| your requirement for water, carbohydrates, electrolytes and other     |
| nutrients vary between his off day and competition day.               |
| On a day-to-day basis, you have to take care of your nutrition by     |
| consuming A WELL BALANCED DIET comprising carbohydrate, fat, protein, |
| electrolytes, vitamins, minerals and water. A nutritionist can extend |
| help in achieving this.                                               |
| In the days preceding a competition, it is better for you to eat LESS |
| CARBOHYDRATE AND MORE FAT AND PROTEIN. It depletes his glycogen       |
| stores in the liver. Then, for a day or two preceding the competition |
| you can go for increased carbohydrate, which replenishes glycogen     |
| storage to an optimal level.                                          |
| It enables you to endure the event better by providing you the        |
| necessary glucose during play by the breakdown of glycogen. Also it   |
| is better to drink beverages containing glucose during rest between   |
| plays and avoid fructose-containing beverages.                        |
| It is because fructose has to be converted into glucose for the body  |
| to use it, which takes time, predisposing the individual to low blood |
| sugars and fatigue. FRUCTOSE CAN ALSO UPSET YOUR STOMACH.             |
| Contrary to popular belief, badminton players require VERY LITTLE     |
| ADDITIONAL PROTEIN than the general population to maintain their      |
| health. Usually, they can get the increments by diet alone. No        |
| protein nutritional supplements are needed.                           |
| Overenthusiastic protein intake predisposes to constant thirst,       |
| dehydration, decreased desire to consume food, loose motions and      |
| added stress on kidneys besides adding to the cost of training.       |
| Among electrolytes, sodium needs can be met just by increasing their  |
| amounts in the diet during competition days. Consuming salt tablets   |
| indiscriminately can cause vomiting sensation, vomiting and bloating  |
| of stomach due to retention of water by the salt thereby affecting    |
| the player's performance. Similarly, additional potassium             |
| requirements can also be met with diet alone by INCLUDING POTASSIUM   |
| RICH FOOD LIKE BANANAS regularly.                                     |
| VITAMINS AND MINERALS ARE TO BE OBTAINED BY DIET OPTIMALLY. Badminton |
| players require vitamins like thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and       |
| minerals like iron to utilize the additional calories they need       |
| during playing. These vitamins and minerals are to be obtained by     |
| including fresh fruits, vegetables, greens, eggs etc. in their diet.  |
| Water should be CONSUMED IN JUST ADEQUATE AMOUNTS before, during and  |
| after play, ideally at the amounts required to quench the player's    |
| thirst. Drinking too much water in the presumption that it can        |
| diminish thirst and improve fitness is wrong as it can lead to water  |
| intoxication. Similarly, drinking too less water thinking that it may |
| slow the game by bloating the stomach is also a misplaced concept.    |
