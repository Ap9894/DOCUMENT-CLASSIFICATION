| FUN BADMINTON DRILLS ARE THE COMPLACENT, NON-COMPETITIVE WAY OF       |
| IMPROVING YOUR BADMINTON SKILLS. At the same time, fun badminton      |
| drills can also be used to improve camaraderie between same club      |
| members, as each drill requires co-operation between participants.    |
| Fun badminton drills can be utilized to improve all the badminton     |
| shots, be it clear, lift, drop or smash. Similarly, fun badminton     |
| drills can significantly improve the court covering skills from       |
| baseline to net or between right and left sidelines.                  |
| Now let us discuss some simple fun badminton drills. Remember, fun    |
| badminton drills have no rules and regulations and you can devise     |
| your own fun badminton drills depending on which shot or aspect of    |
| the game you want to improve.                                         |
| IMPROVING CLEARING, SAME SIDE OF THE COURT                            |
| In this, players A and B, face each other on the same side of the     |
| court, standing near the doubles service line in the back of the      |
| court. Player A clears to player B, and player B in turn clears to    |
| player A. Each should practice clearing drawing an imaginary circle   |
| around them, or just within one-foot movement on all sides in         |
| practicing clearing.                                                  |
| IMPROVING CROSS-COURT CLEARING                                        |
| In this, players A and B face each other from the opposite sides of   |
| the court standing diagonally. Player A clears to player B who in     |
| turn clears it to player A. The same fun badminton drill is repeated  |
| after changing to the other same side of the court. By this, both     |
| left to right and right to left cross-court clearing can be mastered. |
| To make cross court clearing more effective and dynamic, both players |
| A and B can clear the shuttle to the opponents unoccupied corner,     |
| each time running to meet the shuttle and clearing it.                |
| By the same method, standing near the net, player A can drop to       |
| player B, Player B in turn dropping it again to player A. Initially   |
| this can be done with both players standing opposite to each other on |
| the same side. Then it can be practiced cross-court and finally both  |
| players can proceed to running and cross-court dropping.              |
| To master lifting, player A stands near the net and player B stands   |
| near the baseline, initially on the same side. Player B drops to      |
| player A, and player A lifts it to player B. Then the lifting and     |
| dropping is practiced cross-court and finally the running element is  |
| also included, as we have seen in clearing and dropping.              |
| Similar fun badminton drills can be adopted to master driving and     |
| smashing skills in three stages like 1) same side 2) cross court and  |
| 3) cross court and running as explained above.                        |
| FUN BADMINTON DRILLS CAN ALSO BE IN THE FORM OF MOCK DOUBLES GAME.    |
| Here, whoever is committing a mistake makes way for another new       |
| player to participate in the game.                                    |
| This is very useful when many players are there and the practicing    |
| court facilities are very limited. As players keep on changing on     |
| every point scored or lost, everyone gets an equal opportunity to     |
| participate and refine his or her skills.                             |
