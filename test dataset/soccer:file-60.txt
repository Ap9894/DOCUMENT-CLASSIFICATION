“The New Messi” goes to Barcelona

Football’s new prodigy, the nine-year Japanese described as the “new Messi” now Takefusa Kubo walks in the Argentina’s footsteps.

The Ten year old left yesterday for Japan to move to Spain and play for Barcelona.

– I want to reach the top of the club, he says.

Barcelona does not really recruit players who are under 13, but the club have made an exception as they see Kubo as an exceptional talent.

The questions is if it is morally wrong to “buy” players at this age, as I see it there is no obvious answer.

So is the kid the new “Messi”, judge for yourself.
