Coaching Badminton Drills

Coaching badminton drills are going to be one of the most important part
of your badminton training if you want to be a great badminton player.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| These types of drills and good instruction on how to execute them are |
| often difficult to find. The reason they can be so hard to find is    |
| that you really need good step by step instruction for coaching       |
| badminton drills in order to do them correctly. If you are doing your |
| training drills incorrectly you could be doing more harm than good    |
| when trying to perfect your badminton game.                           |
| ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COACHING BADMINTON DRILLS YOU SHOULD LEARN  |
| INCLUDE IN YOUR PRACTICES WILL BE TO WORK ON FOOTWORK. Footwork is    |
| one of the best drills to begin with because if you can control your  |
| foot work you will have more control of where your shuttle will       |
| eventually end up. You of course will need to work on shuttle control |
| and swinging drills as well but we will start for now with footwork.  |
| Footwork drills will help you to add control to your movements on the |
| court as well as help you with control in learning and practicing     |
| with other badminton drills. The drills we will discuss here are      |
| going to be useful as we will cover the same basic footwork that is   |
| used in an actual match of badminton.                                 |
| The first footwork coaching drill that you will want to practice will |
| be moving to the baseline for a forehand swing. In this drill you     |
| will be positioned in the middle of the court in standby prepared for |
| your shot to approach. As you see the shuttle coming you will push    |
| off with the right leg and as you do so turn your body clockwise.     |
| Skip, using both your legs, to the shuttle and follow a forehand      |
| swing through at the baseline. You will then push off with both of    |
| your legs to go to the next shot coming.                              |
| Footwork is important in all your swings and the next coaching        |
| badminton drill is going to the baseline for an around the head shot. |
| Again here you will be positioned in the middle of the court and push |
| off with both legs as you see the shuttle approach. Turn your body so |
| that it is facing the oncoming shuttle, as you hit the shuttle you    |
| will then bring your right leg and right shoulder to the front and    |
| push off to prepare for the returned shuttle.                         |
| Moving to the net for a backhand and forehand are two important       |
| footwork drills that you will also need to learn. Moving to the net   |
| to use a backhand shot will require you to position yourself ready    |
| with your left leg behind your body. As you see the shuttle coming    |
| you will take a small step forward with the left leg and then lunge   |
| with the right as the final step before hitting the shuttle. Moving   |
| to the net for a forehand swing is very similar as you start in a     |
| ready stance, take a small step forward with your left leg and then   |
| lunge with your right as you swing for the shuttle.                   |
| After you have mastered the footwork for general returns you will     |
| want to learn how to position your lower body when receiving a        |
| forehand or backhand smash. Receiving a forehand smash will require   |
| you to lean your entire body to the right and lunge with your right   |
| leg, as you do this you will stretch out your racket hand and take    |
| the smash with a forehand swing. Receiving a backhand smash is for    |
| the most part the opposite. You will lean your entire body to the     |
| left as you do so you will want to turn your body and bring your      |
| right leg across as you lunge with the right leg you will stretch     |
| your racket hand out to take the backhand swing.                      |
| Side to side forehand smash footwork will require you to start with   |
| your body in the ready position. As you start the drill you will bend |
| both your knees to jump into the air in the direction of the forehand |
| side, be sure to jump with both your legs as far as you possibly can  |
| to the forehand side. This drill is very similar to the side to side  |
| around the head smash drill. You will start in the ready position and |
| bend both your knees preparing to jump. You will jump in the          |
| direction of the around the head side, again making sure to jump with |
| both your legs and as far as possible to the around the head          |
| direction.                                                            |
| Finally in the footwork coaching drills is the backhand footwork      |
| drill which will again require you to start in the ready position. As |
| you follow to where the shuttle will need to be hit you will move     |
| forward with your left leg keeping the right leg stretched to the     |
| back. After you have made your swing follow through comfortably and   |
| prepare for your next shot.                                           |
| All of these foot work badminton coaching drills will help you to     |
| perfect the rate at which you make it to the shuttle as well as the   |
| grace and speed you execute on the badminton courts. Practice them    |
| and you will see that the instruction here is simple and easy to      |
| follow, mostly these will be natural movements if you are an          |
| experienced badminton player, but ease does not mean that you can not |
| improve and practice is the best way to improve your game.            |
