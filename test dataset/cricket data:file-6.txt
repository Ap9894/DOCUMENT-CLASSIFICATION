In the solitary Vijay Hazare fixture on Tuesday (October 15), Vidarbha crushed hosts Baroda by 7 wickets in a one-sided encounter at Vadodara. Vidarbha skipper Faiz Fazal lucked out with the toss and opted to bowl first on a wicket that has largely supported the leather-wielders over the course of this tournament.

There were no real partnerships of note, with Rajneesh Gurbani accounting for the openers, and the spin trio of Karnewar, Wakhare and Sarwate running through the rest of the line-up over the course by the 40th over. The final wicket showed some resistance, playing out 50 overs, with No. 10 batsman Rishi Arothe top-scoring with 30, in a 37-run stand with Babashafi Pathan (also the highest stand) to lift the score to 131. Akshay Wakhare was the pick of the bowlers with four middle-order wickets.

The chase was as smooth-sailing as Vidarbha would have imagined it. Fazal and Jitesh Sharma stitched together a 71-run stand for the opening wicket. Sharma's wicket triggered a triune of wickets, but Akshay Wadkar steadied the ship along with Faiz Fazal (who scored a stable half-century) to see Vidarbha through to the target with more than 15 overs to spare - a much-needed morale boost after the thumping at the hands of Uttar Pradesh on Monday (October 14).

Brief Scores:Baroda 131 all-out in 50 overs (Rishi Arothe 30; Akshay Wakhare 4-22) lost to Vidarbha 134-3 (Faiz Fazal 58*, Jitesh Sharma 37; Yusuf Pathan 1-13) by 7 wickets.
