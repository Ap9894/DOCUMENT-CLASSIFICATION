The time has come to say goodbye to real Ronaldo and we have to salute on of our greatest players that has ever entered the pitch. We can say many things about Ronaldo, the size of his stomach or the size of his even larger career. But the fact is that he was the best player for a couple years and if it wasn’t for his injury problems he might have been the greatest player ever. Ronaldo was the main reason Brazil won the World Cup and no player has been so crucial for a World Cup winning team as Ronaldo was in 2002 since Maradona in 1986.

So thank you Ronaldo for all the magic and joy you have brought us and good luck in the future!
