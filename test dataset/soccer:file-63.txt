Goalkeepers are in general a little special, this one is no different.

This event takes place in a league match between Chiangrai and Dessai’s Siam Navy in the Thai Soccer League.

Brazilian Edvaldo is left lying in the penalty area after a dogfight with goalkeeper Chinnakorn Deesai in Siam Navy.

The Thai goalkeeper goes berserk and kicks Edvaldo with full force in the chest.

The Brazilian rolls around several times before he is lying on the grass with severe pain.

The attack resulted – not surprisingly the red card, Chiangrai got penalty as well and nailed the final score to 3-0.

Watch and get amazed at stupidity at its best.
