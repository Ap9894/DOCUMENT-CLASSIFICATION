Northern vs Central Punjab

In their opening game, Central Punjab had Babar Azam scoring a ton at the top of the order. Today, it was Ahmed Shehzad's turn, and importantly, it came in a winning effort unlike Azam's.

After a 448-run slug-fest in Faisalabad, Shehzad's unbeaten century had trumped Asif Ali's hurricane 93 as Northern were beaten with one ball to spare.

Ali was absolutely sensational early on, skyrocketing an innings that was faltering at 59/3 when he came in around the ninth over mark. From there, he spearheaded a brutal onslaught with Mohammad Nawaz playing second-fiddle in their 107-run partnership. Imad Wasim then scored 22 off the last five balls of the innings as Northern posted 222 to complete a remarkable turnaround.

But, as it happened, their lacklustre first-half with the bat came back to bite them. Even after losing Azam and Kamran Akmal early, Shehzad ensured that Central Punjab stayed the course. He found brief, but handy contributors right through the middle-order, which was all that he needed as he scored about half the team's runs himself, while also staying there till the end to get the job done.

Brief Scores: Northern 222-6 in 20 overs (Asif Ali 93, Mohammad Nawaz 51, Umar Amin 38, Imad Wasim 22; Faheem Ashraf 3-44) lost to Central Punjab 226-6 in 19.5 overs (Ahmed Shehzad 111, Saad Nasim 29, Faheem Ashraf 28, Rizwan Hussain 20; Imad Wasim 3-38, Sohail Tanvir 2-50) by 4 wickets.

Southern Punjab vs Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

Wahab Riaz took three wickets and also composed an unbeaten 17-ball 42 to help Southern Punjab secure a four-wicket win versus Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at Faisalabad's Iqbal Stadium. Southern Punjab hunted down the target of 155 for the loss of six wickets and with nine balls to spare.

Riaz ran through the batting order to leave Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in trouble at 51 for 4. At that stage, Mohammad Rizwan and Khushdil Shah joined forces to share a stand of 83 and pilot the side to a score of some respectability.

In pursuit of a rather modest target, Southern Punjab too lost wickets at regular intervals and found themselves in a precarious position at 51 for 5. However, Saif Badar cracked a 35-ball 49 not out, while Riaz clubbed five fours and two sixes to guide Southern Punjab home.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa154/5 in 20 overs (Khushdil Shah 56*, Mohammad Rizwan 45; Wahab Riaz 3-28) lost to Southern Punjab 155/6 in 18.3 overs (Saif Badar 49*, Wahab Riaz 42*; Mohammad Mohsin 3-37) by 4 wickets.
