Swindon Town appoints Paolo Di Canio as their manager, and the local faction of the union GMB is very upset. The General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union withdraw therefore its sponsorship for the club.

– Because we are a union, we cannot have a financial relationship with a club that has a fascist manager. We have no choice. It is unfortunate, but it is what it is, “says Andy Newman, secretary of the GMB in Swindon.

It is amazing how Swindon can appoint a openly fascist to be the head of their Soccer club. It’s disgraceful and they are flirting with evil powers when they are doing this.

Let’s say I won’t be sad if Swindon Town get’s relegated next season.
