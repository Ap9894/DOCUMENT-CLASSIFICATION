| COACHING TIPS FROM YOUR COACH OR TRAINER IN BADMINTON ARE INVALUABLE  |
| because they are the ones who stand near you, watching your game day  |
| after day on court and during practice sessions. They are in a unique |
| position to analyze your weaknesses and drawbacks. They also have     |
| enough stakes in your success, which enable them to correct them      |
| promptly then and there. FOR WHEN THE WARD SUCCEEDS, IT IS THEIR      |
| SUCCESS.                                                              |
| For a beginner, serving is the first problem. Often, they try to      |
| serve and miss. It happens because they drop the shuttle and swing    |
| the racket at the same time. When in fact THEY SHOULD SWING THE       |
| RACKET AFTER THEY RELEASE THE SHUTTLE. Without understanding, they    |
| keep on swinging the racket a little before they release the shuttle, |
| missing again and again. A coach can correct this by arranging the    |
| serving sequence in order, numbering them and make the ward obey the  |
| order.                                                                |
| Similarly some players have difficulty in avoiding the backhand       |
| stroke. Incidentally, the backhand strokes are significantly weaker   |
| than the forehand strokes and must be avoided to the maximum. When    |
| playing across the head forehand stroke may offset inevitable,        |
| playing backhand. Good coaching tips can help overcome this problem   |
| for the player.                                                       |
| One more advantage in getting coaching tips is that different types   |
| of weaknesses are there for different age group players. For example, |
| under 12 players usually have trouble in playing rearcourt shots.     |
| Similarly, under 14 commonly have a weak backhand shot, under 16 have |
| weak around the head forehand shot and under 18 suffer from           |
| inadequate court coverage. The technical deficiencies involving all   |
| the above can only be rectified by coaching tips.                     |
| Similarly, court-covering skills is woefully lacking in beginners and |
| intermediate level players. They look at the professionals and wonder |
| at their court covering skills. They think they can never imagine     |
| attaining their speeds necessary for covering the court.              |
| But in reality, the coaching tips from the trainer or coach will make |
| them understand that IT IS THE MOMENTUM, NOT THE SPEED THAT SEPARATES |
| THEM FROM THE PROFESSIONALS. Coaching tips to cover all portions of   |
| the court from a central position will help them cover all the areas  |
| of the court better.                                                  |
| Also, flick serves are always a problem in beginners. They do not     |
| anticipate them and consequently miss them most of the time. Coaching |
| tips to correct it involve asking them to stand at the place from     |
| where they can lunge forward and reach a drop serve or take a couple  |
| of steps back easily to meet a high or flick serve.                   |
