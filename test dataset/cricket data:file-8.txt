NEPAL CRICKET NEWS

Paras Khadka, the Nepalese national team captain, has decided to resign from his leadership position. The announcement was made directly by the player through the player's official Twitter account as opposed to a press release by the board, which is the norm.

Earlier, Nepal had been reinstated by the ICC as a Full Members, albeit, on a conditional basis, after the election of a Central Working Committee for the Cricket Association of Nepal, consisting of 17 members.

Nepal was suspended in 2016 on the grounds of breaching the ICC regulations, which included the absence of 'free and fair elections' due to government interference. The nation's conditional reinstatement also opens up avenues for funding, which is certainly a good sign for cricket in Nepal, as a plan for Nepal's full reinstatement gets underway.

However, the resignation of the Nepalese captain certainly appears to be a regressive move as a part of the bigger picture. Khadka's achievements include leading Nepal to their first-ever ODI series win against the United Arab Emirates earlier this year, contributing handsomely with a hundred, and remains the only Nepalese player to score a T20I hundred (against Singapore in August).
