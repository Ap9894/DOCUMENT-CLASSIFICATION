As many Soccer fans out there, Im hooked on the show Being Liverpool. The managment aspect of the show and the time we get to spend with Brendan Rodgers is unique in modern soccer. Nowadays every little thing in professional Soccer happens behind closed doors. That’s why it is refreshing to see a club that completely open up their door to the fans. Of course Liverpool F.C has always been a special club.

It will be very interesting to see how long the tv crew will have access to the club, especially when you consider how badly the team has performed in opening of the season. Will the show go on?

I haven’t seen this kind of openness to a top club since the good ol Flavio Briatore
