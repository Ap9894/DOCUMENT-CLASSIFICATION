The Mexican national soccer team is currently in the U.S. to participate in the CONCACAF Gold Cup. The country’s football federation held a press conference during the day in which General Secretary Decio de Maria said that five players have been suspended for doping.

Antonio Naelson, Francisco Javier Rodriguez, Edgar Duenas, Christian Bermudez and Guillermo Ochoa has tested positive for the banned preparation clenbuterol from a doping test taken 21 May, reported Reuters.

Clenbuterol is a substance used to treat asthma, but is said to build muscle and burn fat as well.

The players blame that they in took clenbuterol when they eat a lot of meat or chicken from May 17 to 20
